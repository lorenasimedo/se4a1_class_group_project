The case highlighted in this bug was when the vertical line was identified to cross the left boundary (yet the line goes through the top-left corner) but it could also be seen as crossing the top boundary (at 90 degrees).  Either case should result in no extension, but since it was seen to cross the left boundary (when in fact the line is parallel to it) we did not check for that case and ended up with a crazy value.\r\n\r\nCloses #6366.",
