    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nThe **mapproject** module had a few problems, including a bug, that this PR fixes.  Specifically, when projected coordinates are requested with **-R -J** we always return projected coordinate output. This was not the case if additional options like **-G** or **-A** was used, leading to inconsistencies.  For **-G+uC** (compute distances from the projected coordinates) it in fact used the original coordinates in the calculations, leading to incorrect results (this was the main bug), but it also outputted unprojected coordinates.  The same was true for the angles.  Now, angles can be either based on user coordinates or projected coordinates as well.\r\nI have improved the documentation to clarify this as well.  Tests pass as before.  Closes #4319.\r\n",
