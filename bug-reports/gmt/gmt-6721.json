(int)(key[k][K_MODIFIER]-'0') : 0;\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that most of KEYs have less than 5 characters (K_MODIFIER = 4) and so the above test most of times is accessing uninitialized memory since ``key[k]`` is set via a ``strdup`` call and hence it will not have 5 chars almost never. Setting a test on the key size as in\r\n```\r\n*n_pre = (k >= 0 && strlen (key[k]) >= 5 && key[k][K_MODIFIER] > 0 && isdigit (key[k][K_MODIFIER])) ? (int)(key[k][K_MODIFIER]-'0') : 0;\r\n```\r\nseems to make the random failure to go. I've added a couple of those test in ``gmtapi_extract_argument()`` except in one place (``if ((*n_pre || key[k][K_MODIFIER] == 0) ...`` because doing so caused test failures namely in one that complained that\r\n```\r\nmapproject [ERROR]: No filename provided\r\n```\r\nbut none of the ``mapproject`` KEYs have 5 characters, so that ``if`` test seems to be passing by chance but the size root problem remains there as well.",
