This PR fixes mistakes in both **plot** and **plot3** where the case for small circle and map length was not considered.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding a new test I simply added **k** to the values in _smallcirclevec.sh_ and changed one entry to be in meters.  All tests work as before plus the problem was fixed.  Closes #6166.\r\n",
