    "body": "The way **subplot** tags and **movie** labels and progress indicators work is that the _PostScript_ commands needed to place these items are stored as a \"completion\" _PostScript_ procedure and then the procedure is called at the end of the **subplot** or the whole plot. One tricky thing is that if you for instance change a color in a completion procedure, the next PSL function requesting the same color in the main module will think it was already set, but the procedure has not yet run, hence we fail to set the color.  I had a partial solution to this by resetting key internal parameters, but it was incomplete and failed in **movie** when several **-L** labels with the same color or pen outline were selected (the first label was correct, the next missed the same fill/pen).  This PR gathers all the resetting statements in a new internal function (_gmtplot_reset_PSL_) that is now called at the end of building a completion procedure.  Tests still pass and my problem case also works.\r\n",
