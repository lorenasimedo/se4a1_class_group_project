When I see ``RATA | 0000-12-31T00:00:00`` I read *one day before the end of year*. That is, end of day 364, beginning of day 365, but this is actually the end of day 365. \r\n",

            "body": "Hi Walter, no bug. It's just that this notation does not make sense to me (but apparently it should be only me).\r\nSome Julia examples\r\n```\r\njulia> DateTime(0, 12, 31)\r\n0000-12-31T00:00:00\r\n```\r\nSo this is exactly the same as the RATA Die in GMT. The problem as I said is that when I read that date I see **first second of day 31 of December** and not **last second of that day** as is also implied by Julia time\r\n```\r\njulia> Dates.value(DateTime(0, 12, 31))\r\n0\r\n```\r\nOther examples:\r\n```\r\njulia> DateTime(1, 1, 1)\r\n0001-01-01T00:00:00\r\n```\r\nAgain, I read this as **first second of day January first year 1** and next seams to confirm it\r\n```\r\njulia> DateTime(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0)\r\n0001-01-01T01:00:00\r\n```\r\n**hour 1 of that day**\r\nbut let's see the (milliseconds) of those DateTimes\r\n\r\n```\r\njulia> Dates.value(DateTime(1, 1, 1))\r\n86400000\r\n```\r\nAh, a full day in milliseconds, so ``0001-01-01T00:00:00`` means the end of day, not the beginning.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\njulia> Dates.value(DateTime(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0))\r\n90000000\r\n```\r\nSo first hour of first day is already in second day.\r\n\r\nI know this is in Julia but the ``DateTime(0, 12, 31)  0000-12-31T00:00:00`` is exactly the same as we see in the RATA Die in GMT and afaik they behave the same. So, it works but I don't understand this notation.",

That is, 00:00:01 today is clearly \"inside\" time today, and 23:59:59 is also, but is 00:00:00 the 86400th second in today, or the 0th second in today? There has to be a convention about this; it cannot be both. Are you saying that 0001-01-01T00:00:00 should give the beginning of seconds on the first day of the proleptic Gregorian year system?\r\nMaybe it makes more sense to say this: if we use the proleptic Gregorian year system as our Epoch for the Origin of Time, and we then convert a relative time of 0 to YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss format, what do we get?\r\nW\r\n",
