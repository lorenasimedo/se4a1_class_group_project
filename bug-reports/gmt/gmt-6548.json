Smith and Wessel, 2000](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000240050019) on the isostatic consequence of large landslides in oceanic islands.  This feature required a lot of work on the input, processing of options and modifiers, and the basic math of handling the many tunable functions and parameters that defines a landslide, including time duration.  The man page has been revamped with 5 new figures to explain the purpose and function of the radial slide shape, azimuthal variation within a sector, and the temporal volume fraction curve during the event.  I do not expect anyone to really review this PR since it is very extensive, but I don't think it is necessary.  I am actively using it for research and thus any issues will quickly be found as I am exploring various situations.  As is, it passes all the existing tests, that is, after I fixed a few problems and had to update some of the plots.  The current version is thus better in every way.  I would want it merged for 6.4 since a publication we are working on will use this and reviewers may wish to have access.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things (some has nothing to do with **grdseamount** but got fixed along the way):\r\n\r\n1. A few references got reformatted to keep everything the same\r\n2. Five new documentation scripts to make it possible to navigate the settings\r\n3. Extensive improvements to **grdseamount** documentation\r\n4. Fixed bug where the backwards compatible code **l** (for linear flux rate) was in fact not checked for but instead mixed up in checking the build mode (which is either **c** or **i**).\r\n5. Normalized the error function volumetric curve so it goes exactly from 0-1; otherwise the first (and last) volume increments are way too large and very jarring during a movie.\r\n6. Changed a few of the existing scripts to accommodate the above bug fix so we don't need to update too many figures\r\n7. Fixed error in the flux curve plot - it had a factor of 6/2 instead of 3/sqrt(2) inside the error function\r\n8. Fix the seamount types script so that it handles the singularity in the polynomial equation (no way **gmtmath** can know this).  **grdseamount** computes that same shape via a function that was fixed to handle the singularity (#6476).\r\n9. Fix error in **-W** parsing where it used **GMT_IS_CUBE** instead of **GMT_IS_GRID**.  Harmless but wrong.\r\n10. Fixed (via separate PRs) several GMT issues that was discovered during the **grdseamount** work, such as #6547, #6536, #6535, #6523, and #6496; there may be others I forgot.\r\n\r\nThe **-S** option lets uses specify one or more slides per seamount, each with a different set of parameters and time history.  In crossection it looks something like this (but the shape of the slide is tunable):\r\n\r\n![GMT_seamount_specs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/162637618-151f1ef9-968b-402f-a0e8-21d655f53fe9.png)\r\n\r\n",
