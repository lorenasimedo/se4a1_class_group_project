While data files created there become available to the job scripts via the **DIR_DATA** variable, there is no mechanism to read gmt.conf files from other places than ~, ~/.gmt, and current directory.  I think the solution is to determine if a gmt.conf file exists in the top directory, and if it does then, as you show, we can insert a `cp ../gmt.conf . `command into the job script.  This probably applies to **movie** as well.",
