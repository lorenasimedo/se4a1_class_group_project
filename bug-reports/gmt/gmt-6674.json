The issue had to do with round-off in region coordinates when the data tile was read in via _GMT_Read_Data_ but the intensity was cut out by using the intensity file and **-R**.  This PR now also reads the intensity tile via _GMT_Read_Data_ and hence the rounding (if any) will be the same.\r\n\r\nGive this branch a shot, @seungsep.\r\n\r\n",
