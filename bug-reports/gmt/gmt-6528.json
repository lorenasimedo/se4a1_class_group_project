    "body": "\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\npsmeca.c calculates a rotation angle called delaz that is added to nodal plane strikes to correct for map rotation in oblique projections. In some edge cases (mainly for pure double couple mechanisms), psmeca recalculates nodal plane strikes from principal axes. Because the axes are corrected by delaz already, a subsequent correction to nodal plane strike causes over-rotation of the nodal planes. The proposed code fix in the pull request for this issue simply checks whether a correction has already been applied before the second correction is done.\r\n\r\n",
