    "body": "We used _gmt_segment_BB_outside_map_BB_ to skip segments outside the map bounding box but that only works well in **plot** and **plot3** but for **wiggle** we do not know the plot coordinates of the line which may well be inside the domain even though the x,y coordinates are outside.  The solution is to remove that call.  Here is a test derived from the report in the [forum](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/problem-with-wiggle-at-plot-boundary/2414/5), where the red dots are the coordinates of the input line.  In the bottom frame all points are outside yet the wiggle persists, as it should:\r\n\r\n![wiggle_outside](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/147179351-ff6a443e-0046-42f1-a912-7f1beb0d67f2.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
