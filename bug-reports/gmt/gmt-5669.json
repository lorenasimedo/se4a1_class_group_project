It really should be .jpeg of course (and .tiff) but for eons this has been abbreviated to three characters due to DOS/early Windows limitations that no longer are relevant.  Still, it is very common to see .jpg on all OS. I noticed that if I run the above command with tiff or tif it works in both cases, yet the output file is called *.tif in both cases.  This is because tiff and tif reduce to 't' and that is passed to **psconvert** who will create the .tif extension [it has no knowledge of the t originating as tiff].  However, if jpeg is used it is reduced to j (as is jpg) and in both cases **psconvert** produces a .jpg file.  Clearly there is an issue in docs which cannot find the .jpeg file it expects somehow.\r\n\r\nSo, I assume we want this behavior: File extension should match exactly the requested graphics argument (jpeg -> .jpeg, etc).  The only exception is PNG which is the uppercase flag to set transparent png.\r\n\r\nI think **gmt end** who is doing the calling to **psconvert** knows what the original extensions are and that is the place to insert a file rename call for those two cases.  OK?\r\n",

I can add J and T as \"new\" format flags in **-T** and they would supply the full jpeg and tiff extensions\r\n2. We could add a modifier (e.g., **+l** for long) that turns off the 3-char extension limitation.\r\n\r\nSeems to me it would be simpler to use **-TJ** than to say **-Tj+l** for long.  So I suggest we do J and T.  What you think? The alternative is to continue to let **psconvert** only know about 3-char extensions and handle this via a rename in **end**.\r\n",

Macs even tried to get rid of extensions and Windows even copied that stupid move by hiding known extensions from displayed file names in file manager. ``*.jpeg`` or ``*.jpg`` should be exactly the same from user experience perspective. It's not exactly the same with ``*.tiff`` and ``*.tif`` where there is a, sometimes used, assumption that ``*.tiff`` means a *geotiff* file, whereas ``*.tif`` not. But this is not a convention assumed by us (though I do) so let's just ignore it.\r\n\r\nBut we have a true issue because Dongdong's example raises an error. The best solution for me is just deal with it under the hood and have **gmt end** do the renaming. Don't complicate it with further flags.",
