    "body": "See issue #6748 for an example. Note: that issue is not yet solved but it fails silently when ``GMT_Write_Data()`` is called with a ``Ctrl->G.file = NULL`` which, given that what is tried to saved is a grid, falls into the condition (gmt_api#L9721)\r\n```\r\nelse if (output == NULL && geometry) {\t/* Case 2: Save to stdout.  Register stdout first. */\r\n\t\tif (family == GMT_IS_GRID) return_error (API, GMT_STREAM_NOT_ALLOWED);\t/* Cannot write grids to stream */\r\n```\r\nbut since the calling program (``gmtbinstats`` in this case) returns ``Return (API->error);`` and no error message is printed. \r\nIn the Julia side I only see ``Programming error, output matrix is empty`` that is a message printed when the return grid arrived empty into Julia. If the original error message ``GMT_STREAM_NOT_ALLOWED`` had been printed all debugging job would have been simpler.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to fix this. Seems  ``return_error (API, GMT_STREAM_NOT_ALLOWED)`` is not doing its job right.",
