    "body": "I have been having some issues with using the -SE option with psxy and linear projections. I've specifically been having issues with ellipses, but I think the problem can be best described with this example:\r\n\r\necho \"0 0 0.1\" | gmt psxy -JX10c/10c -R-0.1/0.1/-1/1 -SE- -Gred -Wthinner,black -Bxa0.05 -Bya0.5 -BSWne > tmp.ps\r\ngmt psconvert -Tf -Z -P -A tmp.ps\r\n\r\nThis should plot a circle with a diameter of 0.1 units. As you can see from the attached plot, this command isn't working how I would expect. It seems the x and y direction are flipped (i.e. in this case the shape should be rotated by 90 deg).\r\n\r\n[tmp.pdf](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/files/6062185/tmp.pdf)\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n* Operating system: ubuntu\r\n* GMT version (`gmt --version`): 6.1.1\r\n",
