So the failure is a \"feature\".  Before -i was introduced, a -S would mean we have no idea how many columns to read since the symbol could be a circle or an ellipse, requiring 1 or 3 columns.  However, in your case we do know you expect to only pass 3 coordinates plus symbol code, and then we would actually have to introduce checks that would complain if we read a symbol code that requires more than one data column. This dependency of -S on -i was never considered.  Finally, all these cases requires ascii files since symbol code is a text, so the reading is very specific for -S.  We can call it a bug but basically it is something not implemented.  I suggest I update the documentation for this case since I do not think we want to add the -S -i extra checks on number of columns.",
