    "body": "Some time in the past this issue came up and it got a fix that I am not that happy with.  The issue is what do we do if we are given a text file that only has text, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome test line\r\nA B C another\r\nHello\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile these generally cannot be used in GMT, they are allowed in **batch** and **movie**.  Here is the relevant section in the _gmtio_examine_current_record_ function.  The outer if-test you see means when we find just text and **-i** was not used to indicate a selection and **-fs** was not selected to indicate strings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tif (found_text && col == 0 && !GMT->common.i.select && phys_col_type != GMT_IS_STRING) {\t/* Has to be a non-GMT header with just text starting in the first column - treat as header */\r\n\t\tif (strncmp (GMT->init.module_name, \"batch\", 5U) && strncmp (GMT->init.module_name, \"movie\", 5U)) {\t/* Make exception for these modules what often will just read text lines */\r\n\t\t\tgmt_M_free (GMT, type);\r\n\t\t\treturn GMT_NOT_OUTPUT_OBJECT;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen that is true then we only allow this to happen in **movie** and **batch**.  The thinking was that such files are not useful to the vast majority of GMT modules.  However, **gmtinfo** should be added I think.\r\n\r\nWhy all this in the first place? Well, cannot recall the exact case but I think it was to guard against junk (non-GMT headers).  The above works well (**movie** may just take a file with labels, for instance, as the record number equals the frame number).  Can you think of any other GMT modules that should be allowed to return just text (**pstext** is separate anyway)?\r\n\r\nNote: **gmt info** works fine if one remembers to add **-fs** for strings.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have comments, @joa-quim and @meghanrjones.",
