However, The sign of this level matters: Contrast these two cases, both with a water depth W = 5000 m:\r\n\r\n1. Input z is a positive bump on the seafloor, varying from 0 to 1000 m.  We first subtract sea level and now z goes from -5000 to -4000.  We find mid level to be -4500 and keep the absolute value z_level = 4500.  It is used in Parker exponent exp (-k*z_level) for upward continuation. We then compute slab thickness as h = W - z_level = 5000 - 4500 = 500m. We need to add the 500m slab gravity (a positive value) to the undulations obtained by the FFT to make sure all values are positive.\r\n2. Input z is a negative bump on the seafloor, varying from 0 to -1000 m.  We first subtract sea level and now z goes from -6000 to -5000.  We find mid level to be -5500 and keep the absolute value z_level = 5500. It is used in Parker exponent exp (-k*z_level) for upward continuation. We then compute slab thickness as h = W - z_level = 5000 - 5500 = -500m. We need to add the -500m slab gravity (a negative value) to the undulations obtained by the FFT to make sure all values are negative.\r\n\r\nIn master, h is computed as absolute value of (W - z_level), hence both of the above cases end up with a positive correction due to a 500 m slab, yet the second case needs it subtracted.  Hence the sign of W - z_level needs to be retained.\r\n\r\nNo tests were affected, apparently.  We need more tests, obviously.",
