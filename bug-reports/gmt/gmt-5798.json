This also makes it easier to debug this feature which is still not working in GMT (and affects **grdimage**, for instance, where the entire image must be read in, leading to excessive run times and memory requirements for high-resolution global grids).  Derives bits and pieces from stalled PR #4004. Note: I also updated the **KEYS** and _GMT_Encode_Options_ so it should be possible to receive the image back from the externals as well.\r\n\r\nTrying this command:\r\n\r\n`gmt grdcut @earth_day_01m -R0/10/0/10 -I -Gcut.png`\r\n\r\nYields an image with the correct region, increment meta data but likely bad info on the order or RGB, yet the pixels are in the right layout (since Africa outline etc is correct) and the region matches that of a pscoast plot:\r\n\r\n![cut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/134428079-f69aeedc-777c-4523-987f-32a0aea78ae1.png)\r\n\r\nHoping @joa-quim can advise where to make changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR allocates memory only for the subset and pad, and currently grdimage commands like the one below will crash in the PR because it assumes a full image.  This will be dealt with once we correctly can read subsets of images.  However, in master, this comand\r\n\r\n`gmt grdimage @earth_day_01m -R0/10/0/10  -JQ5.07614213198c -png out`\r\n\r\nyields this (same-size) image (for comparison with above):\r\n\r\n![out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/134428812-c81e2b82-9dfd-410f-a8fc-cdbdb01c1319.png)\r\n\r\nClearly, this is an incorrect region despite having the RGB in the right order, so this seems to be a bug in master.  I suggest we work on getting the subset to work correctly via **grdcut** and then the rest will be simpler.",

In this PR, looks like **grdimage** with an image crashes due to the changes we are trying in the i/o for images.  This will go away when we are finished.\r\n2. I did not expect master to give the wrong image but I think @federico pointed out some problems with grdimage using the earth_day stuff earlier so maybe the same.  I don't really want to stop this PR to fix that in master since the real solution is the one we will get from this PR.",

            "body": "Stepping through to see what happens to the indexed colors.\r\n\r\nLine 539 gmt_gdalread.c: We are getting the colors one by one from GDAL and storing in the Ctrl->ColorMap 4x256 array.  For each color i = 0, 1, ...you do this\r\n\r\n```\r\nGDALGetColorEntryAsRGB(hTable, i, &sEntry);\r\nCtrl->ColorMap[j++] = sEntry.c1;\r\nCtrl->ColorMap[j++] = sEntry.c2;\r\nCtrl->ColorMap[j++] = sEntry.c3;\r\nCtrl->ColorMap[j++] = sEntry.c4;\r\n```\r\nThat means the RGBA for the first entry in the colormap is the first 4 values in Ctrl->ColorMap.  For my example that is 224,164,84,255.\r\n\r\nThen in Line 177 (gmt_gdalwrite.c) you place these values into another array, this time 4x256 float:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (k = 0; k < n_colors; k++) {\r\n\tto_GDALW->C.cpt[k] = I->colormap[k] / 255.0;\r\n\tto_GDALW->C.cpt[k + n_colors]   = gmt_M_is255(I->colormap[k + n_colors]);\r\n\tto_GDALW->C.cpt[k + n_colors*2] = gmt_M_is255(I->colormap[k + n_colors*2]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here, let k = 0.  Then you get the red (colormap[0]) but not the green from the first (since that would be colormap[1], divide by 255 and store it in the same place in the cpt array.  I guess this is OK but not sure why you do it this way since it does not follow the structure of colormap.\r\n\r\nFinally, just before we call GDAL to write (line 375) you do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (i = 0; i < nColors; i++) {\r\n\tsEntry.c1 = (short)(gmt_M_s255(ptr[i]));\r\n\tsEntry.c2 = (short)(gmt_M_s255(ptr[i+nColors]));\r\n\tsEntry.c3 = (short)(gmt_M_s255(ptr[i+2*nColors]));\r\n\tsEntry.c4 = (short)255;\r\n\tGDALSetColorEntry(hColorTable, i, &sEntry);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, try i = 0.  This picks supposedly an r, g, b from the ptr (which is the cpt above) and then loads up the sEntry structure. For i = 0 these become 224,72,72,255. So no longer 224,164,84,255.  I think that is why the image looks junk.  Please let me know what you were trying to do here, @joa-quim \r\n",

            "body": "Ping @meghanrjones, @Esteban82, @joa-quim, @seisman: This PR is now ready for serious review.  It has grown a bit from the initial attempt but should now be acceptable.  Here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n1. gmt_gdalread.c: Implemented image subsets so that we no longer have to read the entire image to plot it (which gets excessive for high-resolution global grids).  This involved passing the region in, setting the padding (similar to grids), ensuring we do not use the region if the image has no geographic region information, and handling the situation when the desired subset straddles the periodic boundary, resulting in two separate image chunks being read into the same buffer. Because pad is now added I am able to set data BCs when we cut a subset out of a larger image (as we do for grids).\r\n2. gmt_gdalwrite.c: Now strips off the image pad before writing an image. The non-file output options (i.e., to memory) may need further test cases and debugging since those have not been exercised by GMT I think.\r\n3. grdcut.c: The temporary **-I** is now gone and **grdcut** detects if given a grid or image.  It can apply the same operators to both grids and images, except for **-Z** which requires a grid.\r\n4. gmt_support.c: The boundary condition settings for images (_gmtlib_image_BC_set_) was based on the corresponding one for grids (_gmt_grd_BC_set_) got a bunch of updates, many of them cosmetic (call the image variable I not G, shorten expressions by using img = I->data).  The biggest change was to examine the results of the various boundary conditions.  Because these are essentially derivatives forced to be zero along the borders, they can amplify noise in the data, as also happens with grids.  For instance, to have d2/dx2 = 0 along w or e, we do things like `out - 2*on + in = 0` and solve for `out = 2*on - in`.  This allows us to set the image values in the pad. Ah, but the pad is part of the image and is an unsigned char, yet the results of the BCs often fall outside 0-255.  In fact, here is a plot of the values of computed outside image nodes from the tests involving images that exceed 0-255:\r\n\r\n![BC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/134791560-d5663d5c-fc4c-4e60-b567-81949c6b6b83.png)\r\n\r\nSo before, _gmtlib_image_BC_set_ would happily compute 357 and try to store that in an unsigned char, resulting in truncation to 101.  Later, if the image needs resampling by the bicubic/bilinear operator we are using incorrect values in the pads, resulting in incorrect  resampled image values near the borders.\r\n\r\nBecause _gmtapi_import_image_ now uses **-R** I had to make a few changes where we read in an image but the **-R** is _not_ meant as a subset.  This happens in **grdimage** (e.g., when we read some dumb PNG and want it to take on the **-R** bounds), **psimage** (where **-R** and **-J** are used for projection setup purposes, never for image subset), and when reading CPTs with patterns (again, any **-R** has to do with projection, not subset).  With those implementations I get three failures: marbles.sh, png_image.sh, and mixcompose.sh.  These look fine to me but instead of updating them I thought it would be good for you to run the test and see for yourself.  Note the differences are mostly due to the fixed BC scheme as in the past this would not clip the values outside 0-255, just throw out the higher bits.\r\n\r\nOnce you agree that these three are fine, please approve and I will update the PS before merging. Or let me know if you find something odd.\r\n",
