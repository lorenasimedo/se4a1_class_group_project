    "body": "Because of the **+s**_offset_ modifier to **-T**, there are two types of running frame/job counters: Those that go from 0 up (used internally) and those that go from _offset_ and up (used in naming products).  I mistakenly used the latter as argument to the _status_ array and hence we would exceed array bounds.  Not noticed until[ this case](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/movie-t-flag/2889) on the forum since **+s** has not been exercised by anyone I guess.\r\n\r\nTo remind myself I renamed _first_frame_ and _first_job_ to _first_i_frame_ and _first_i_job_ to match the other internal counters. The key bug happened at lines 929 and 2534, respectively.",
