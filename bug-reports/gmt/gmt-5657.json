Turns out that when **colormap** used **-B** we did not draw gridlines since the Cartesian axis function used by design skipped gridlines as those were expected to be done later in the _gmt_map_basemap_ function.  Except for **colormap** which does not use _gmt_map_basemap_ and hence there was no call to plot gridlines.  This PR fixes that issue, updates a test original PS (_legcpt.sh_) that now failed (since it should have had gridlines but did not), and did some minor coding improvements to make it easier to understand the algorithms related to custom annotations.\r\n",
