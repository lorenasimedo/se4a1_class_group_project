I had added a check that turned bicubic sampling off (unless **-n** was set) to avoid extending the region and getting z-values that _could_ bias the min/max range and hence the CPT stretching.  This PR removes that check (we _do_ want bicubic sampling as default) but we now recompute the grid zmin/zmax to only apply to the region specified on the command line.  Lots of \"failures\" because\r\n\r\n1. We are undoing the previous decision related to the spline (hence tiny mismatches throughout most images\r\n2. The z-limits for the inside region may differ from those of the extended grid region, affecting the CPT lookup.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe this is a better fix. We should not update any doc *.ps as these will soon go into DVC anyway.",
