    "body": "@ayyubibrahimi sorry for not spotting the problems in the original pull request but 2 things:\r\n- Please make sure that `make` run without error before committing.\r\n- I see that the original problem was with the `match/scott_pd.py` script. I looked at your script and essentially what you were doing are:\r\n    1. Assign `pprr.uid` to `cprr.uid`. This is okay.\r\n    2. Assign `post.uid` to `pprr.uid`. I don't know why you do this, maybe I did this in a script in the past but surely most scripts should no longer be doing this. Why would we need the `uid` from POST when we already have the roster data? We only take `uid` from POST if the roster data is not available and so we have to lift the roster from POST. \r\n    3. Assign `post.uid` to `cprr.uid`. Again, not needed because we already have roster data.\r\n    4. Combine `pprr` and `cprr` into `post_event` which I think you did because you didn't understand what `post_event` is. `post_event` are `OFFICER_LEVEL_1_CERT` and `OFFICER_PC_12_QUALIFICATION` events extracted from POST for a particular agency. Because matching is needed to extract these events from POST, this `post_event` data is often produced in matching scripts instead of fusing scripts. Please look at `lib.post.extract_events_from_post`.\r\n\r\nI think you are already doing the clean step well, just some hiccups in the match step. Please keep up the good work!",
