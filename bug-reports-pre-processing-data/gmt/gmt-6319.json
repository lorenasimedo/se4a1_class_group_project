    "body": "See #6299 for background.  This PR ensures that **grdtrack** first selects a gridline-registered version of a remote grid unless registration is specified by the user.  This ensures that sampling of arbitrary points is optimally handled.  The change is documented in the man page.  Also, since we now no longer add a grid pad for non-bicubic sampling we must allow for a node outside the range when the input point lands on the final node.  This is not an error (since the weight is zero) so we simply skip rather than cause a crash via _assert_.  Closes #6299.\r\n\r\nA point of discussion may be this proposal which would extend the solution above:\r\n\r\nThe default resolution chosen for remote grids without specific resolution shall be:\r\n\r\n1. All plotting modules: pixel-registration\r\n2. All processing modules: gridline-registration\r\n\r\nThe argument here is loosely that the plotters are fine with the pixel registration and some are only pixel anyway (think images), while data processors often (but not always) need to consider resampling.\r\n\r\nEmbracing that suggestion would mean the user of @earth_relief_01d in **grdcut**, **grdsample**, **grdclip**, **grd2xyz**, etc would default to gridline registration since for calculations that is the better format (i.e., default GMT output anyway from surface, etc.).  Thoughts, @GenericMappingTools/core ?",
