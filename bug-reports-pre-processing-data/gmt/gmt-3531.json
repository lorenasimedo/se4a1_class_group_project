This worked, but appears to have the knock-on effect of setting the pen thickness of the second segment to 1p, rather than 'thinnest' as set by -W. But then for the third segment onwards, the correct thickness (thinnest) is used. What's going on here? (And should I just put my strike-slip and reverse faults in different data files?)\r\n\r\n**Actual outcome**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"439\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49723355/85577232-f860cb80-b630-11ea-9e84-f1d90057cb04.png\">\r\n\r\n(The segments go from east to west)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Operating system: macOS Mojave 10.14.1 \r\n* GMT version (`gmt --version`): 6.0.0",
