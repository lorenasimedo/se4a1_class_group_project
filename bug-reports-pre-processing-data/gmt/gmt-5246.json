            "body": "Good catch.  I think the initial idea was that perhaps the user had flagged holes as values in the grid that were, say, -999 instead of NaN so -N-999 would then be used and the code would deal with that.  I still think that is a good idea.  The simplest way to implement it would be to have a quick loop up front to replace those -999 with NaN since the rest of the module expects NaNs.\r\n\r\nThe man pages also wrongly says that -As is experimental but it is fully implemented and we have test cases that shows it.\r\n\r\nI guess none of this rises to the level of a fix needed brfore 6.2.0 so I will make two separate WIP PRs.",
