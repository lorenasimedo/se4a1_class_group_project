    "body": "See #6174 for background.  This PR eliminates the extension of the grid region due to the interpolant and only retains the 0.5*inc extension for pixel grids. This changes some grid resampling a tiny bit leading to 5 **grdimage** failures (_ex02, east_map_8, pacific_map_2, filtertest, polarhole_).  However, it improves the situation with auto-range CPTs.  Here is the situation in master. Note: The top row is reading `@earth_relief_01d` while bottom row is first cutting, then reading the subset:\r\n\r\n![cpt_auto_master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/147842889-019b48a0-623b-40e9-9b98-1b34c256f812.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here is the same plots with this branch:\r\n\r\n![cpt_auto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/147842891-58015f2d-def8-4439-9659-61151ee6f0a3.png)\r\n\r\nThe small differences you still can see are due to:\r\n\r\nThe differences between the data boundary conditions (top row) and the natural boundary conditions (bottom row).\r\nThe extra row/column considered for pixel grids (right column) to ensure no data gaps near the borders.\r\n\r\nMoral: While pixel grids on auto-stretching CPT can still differ due to the extra few and column data affecting the range, those values are actually useful in constraining the surface whereas in master we are including nodes that are not visible in the final plot when computing the z-range.  So this is a good improvement I think.",
