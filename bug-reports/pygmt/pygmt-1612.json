    "body": "**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nThe \"PRICIPAL_AXIS\" convention has 10 parameters: the value (in 10*exponent dynes-cm), azimuth, and plunge of N, T, and P axis, and also the exponent of the values. See https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/supplements/seis/meca.html#s for the official documentation. Currently, the `meca` function defines the following parameters:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/4b80f3c269f39917c8bb7ee96c5a253279877024/pygmt/src/meca.py#L255-L266\r\n\r\nThe parameter name `t_exponent`, `n_exponent`, and `p_exponent` is inaccurate and confusing, and should be renamed to `t_value`, `n_value`, and `p_value`.\r\n\r\nI think we should make the change in a backward-compatible way and it should go through the deprecation cycle.\r\n",

The `meca` function was rewritten in PR #1784, which already brought some incompatible changes\r\n2. The `PRICICIPAL_AXIS` convention is not commonly used.\r\n3. It's a bug and was fixed in #1784, and we don't have to keep backward-compatibility with buggy behavior.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen it if anyone insists that backward-compatibility is necessary for it.",
