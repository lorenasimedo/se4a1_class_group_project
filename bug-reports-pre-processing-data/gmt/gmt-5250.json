Isolating the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat << EOF > t.txt\r\n> 0.5 0 12p 0 Times-Roman CM 12p 0.9i c\r\n\"Black Box\" Filter\r\nEOF\r\ngmt pstext -R0/1/-0.5/1 -JX1i/0.75i -P -M -Glightgray -W1p -F+f+a+j -N -V t.txt > t.ps\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that GMT defaults for what constitutes a data header record is controlled by **IO_HEADER_MARKER** which has as default the list of characters `#%!;\"',#`, where the comma separates input and output header markers.  This list is newer than my script and causes the script to fail, hence not backwards compatible.  But wait, when we read input to **pstext -M** we are reading plain text sentences, hence it makes no sense to look for header records in the middle of this.  So the solution here seems to be to temporarily reset the input **IO_HEADER_MARKER** to just # so that quoted text and percentages can pass as given\r\n\r\nAgreed, @joa-quim @meghanrjones @seisman ?",
