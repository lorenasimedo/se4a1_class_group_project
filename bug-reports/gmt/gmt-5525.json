That is just too much work to implement for this minor adjustment.  What we could do is this:\r\n\r\n1. I can do the quick/dirty z-adjustment for a Mag 5 symbol size given in **-S** and the optional label.  This gives an adjusted raw z-range that is pretty close but you may have some symbols of larger magnitude that happen to be at the bottom/top that will be only partially dealt with.\r\n2. **+r** could take a few more arguments: **a** for auto will do the auto roundoff, i.e., the same as **-Ra.**, while **+re** would be exact [Default].  We could use **+rA** for the same as **+ra** except we let _zmin_ be forced to zero (surface of Earth) to avoid ranges like 5/400, for instance.\r\n3.  +r could take optional _dx_ which would round the x-distances to a multiple of _dx_ [Default is raw distance range].\r\n4. We could allow **+z**_dz_ which would round the determined range to a multiple of _dz_. This would override the auto for z if **+ra** is given, for instance, but **+rA** would still set _zmin_ to 0.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

The auto-range handling symbol size and labels work pretty well, and exactly for **-M** (without **-M** I base my calculation on a max magnitude 8 event).  The **-A** option has been upgraded:\r\n\r\n-**Aa**|**b**|**c**|**d**_params_[**+d**_dip_][**+r**[**a**|**e**|_dx_]][**+w**_width_][**+z**[**s**]**a**|**e**|_dz_|_min_/_max_]\r\n\r\nI think this should cover all the bases.  The default as before sets the exact domain which now includes the size of the symbols.  You can then explore the auto rounding or fixed rounding or clamping.

That is, if my data had a range from 100 to 200, then the range I get for the graph is 95-205. In this way I would get in the chart a small margin without data on the edges and this would be regardless of the values of my data. I hope this is understood. \r\n\r\n",

I'm OK with the behavior, but it should be better documented if this is the expected behavior.~~\r\n4. `-Aa111/33/119/33+r+z20`: the plotted depth range is about -5 to 65 km, but I expect it to be 0 to 60 km. Is it because beachball sizes are also considered in this case?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** \r\n\r\n- For point 3: I just read the documentation again. I think the documentation has already explained it clearly.\r\n- For point 4: Just saw your comment in https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/pull/5525#issuecomment-890455369. It's OK to extend the depth range based on beachball size, but users may be confused by this behavior.",
