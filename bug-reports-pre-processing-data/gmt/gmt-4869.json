    "body": "These modules were initially created by IPGG in Paris in the 1990s and eventually donated to us for continued upkeep.  Because no guidelines for option selection existed at the time, I have had to make major changes over the years, such as preventing that these modules eat up available common options for the rest of GMT (e.g., **-o**, etc).  Yet, we still have some discordant notes in the system.  Today we fixed **coupe** **-Z**_cpt_ to be **-C**_cpt_ like in the rest of GMT.  However, **meca** also uses **-Z** that way, and **-C** is used and does something else.  I have looked at the four modules, determined available option codes, and looked for simplicities. Here is my assessment and proposal for an update.  The update will be backwards compatible, of course.\r\n\r\n1. CPT color are optionally needed by **meca**, **coupe**, might be a very useful addition for **velo**, and possibly for **polar** if there is a use for this.  Thus, I wish to make space for **-C** for all four, wether they presently use a CPT or not.\r\n2. **meca** and **polar** have a similar **-C** option, but with some differences: In **meca**, **-C** forces us to read two extra columns with an alternative lon,lat location where the symbol will be plotted, and then a line is drawn from that location to the original location.  Optionally, a small circle (pen only) is drawn at the original location.  For **polar**, there really is no lon,lat input so **-D** is used to specify where on the map you want this hemisphere plot to be centered.  Its **-C** option then takes a second location and then the same thing happens: hemisphere plot is placed at **-C**_lon/lat_ and a line with optional circle goes to the **-D**_lon/lat_ point. Here, I think it makes most sense to let the functionality of **-C** be just modifiers to **-D** instead, thus leaving **-C** free.  For **meca** I think it is best not to clutter **-S** with more modifiers but simply introduce **-A** as the new option to take over for the old **-C**.  That way can use **+a** with **polar** **-D** for some mnemonic value.\r\n4. I guess because of the projection onto the crossection, **coupe** does not have a similar **-C** facility to adjust location of symbol.  Might this be conceivable useful to allow for, @seisman ? If it is, then uniformity across these modules would imply we use the common **-Z** letter (and **+z** in polar) instead of **-A**.\r\n5. Of course, the other issue with the existing **-C** option is that one takes a pen while the other takes a **+p**_pen_ modifier.  Both take an optional **+s**_size_ to affect the circle size.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n1. Make all these module have **-C**_cpt_ or have the capacity to add one\r\n2. Depending on the coupe question, let ? be either A or Z. Then convert **meca -C** to **meca -?** and **polar -C** to **-D+?**.\r\n3. Use **+p**_pen_ modifier in both cases, but still honor pen when in backwards mode.\r\n\r\nPlease comment, @GenericMappingTools/core.\r\n",
