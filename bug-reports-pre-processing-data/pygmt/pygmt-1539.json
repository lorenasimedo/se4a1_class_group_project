The more information we have, the easier it will be for us to track this down. -->\r\n\r\nThe current test result is affected by https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/issues/1313, such that no scaling is applied to the sizes despite the argument `incols=\"0,1,2+s0.005\"` being included in the test. Since the units are cm and the data values in col 2 of pygmt/tests/data/points.txt are all less than 1, such a scaling would leading to no visible circles being plotted.\r\n",
