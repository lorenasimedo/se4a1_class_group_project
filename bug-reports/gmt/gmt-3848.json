    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nThis PR started out with trying to generalize _GMT_Read_Data_ for **GMT_IS_MATRIX**.  Now, if you pass the geometry **GMT_IS_SURFACE** then we read the file as a grid but return a matrix.  The conversion between grid to matrix is simple (we do this in the general import_grid anyway) but it pointed out some issues when testing via a short C code starting a session: Since no modules were involved, the remote files were unknown.  So now we added a check to refresh the server if the list is NULL.  The test codes now pass remote file names and **GMT_IS_SURFACE** and this works fine.\r\nThen the same was applied to _GMT_Write_Data_, i.e., ability to write a **MATRIX** (camouflaging as a grid) to a grid file.  This exposed another problem in gmt_nc.c in that the file-specific chunking settings were not reset, causing a second _GMT_Write_Data_ to fail.\r\nI have updated a few of the testapi*.c codes to indicate the geometry (**GMT_IS_POINT** if just a dumb text table and **GMT_IS_SURFACE** if a real grid), and updated some of the PS originals that changed due to the roundoff involved in the text version.\r\nA new test program testapi_grid2matrix.c was added to test the reading of a grid into a matrix and then writing the matrix out as a grid, and the new test apimat2grd.sh runs this and makes a plot.\r\n\r\nBecause there are several bug fixes involved in this PR I have labeled this as a bug fix which requires backport.",
