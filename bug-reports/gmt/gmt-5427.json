I decided that it would be better if GMT i/o could pick up these as headers without the required leading `#` sign and added some code to catch cases where we found text and all \"columns\" were read as NaNs - that is clearly text.  All tests passed with that, except _pssac_geo.sh_.  The reason has to do with the file station.list which violates the GMT directive of numerical values followed by trailing text, since it has a text in the first column and lon, lat next to it; it should be` lon lat name`.\r\n\r\nWhile I need to do some more work on my checking (since this file should not really say we found 3 Nans only 1), I wonder if the station.list can be changed (and hence the script - take out the -i) or if this is some old convention from elsewhere that we cannot change?\r\n\r\nThe plan is that once this work generally across GMT we can revert those module-specific fixes in seis and geodesy since those records would be correctly flagged as header records and then normally skipped",
