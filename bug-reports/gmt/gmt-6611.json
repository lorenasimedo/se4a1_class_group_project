So that one captures angles from 265 to 260 (-95 to -85).  It works as you say.\r\n\r\nFor the -A20 case it is the same, with bin centers at 0, 20, etc.  270 is not one of those, so it is 260 280 (or -100, -80).  Your point at -90 thus falls into the bin that is centered at -80 and goes from -90 to -70.\r\n\r\nSo in my thinking, both examples work.   I see no bug here.",

To me it is just like any other histogram I am aware of and hence the bins are fixed once you pick a width and offset.  You seemed surprised by what you got so I was wondering what lead you to believe it would not be a histogram.  If so, perhaps I could add a sentence or two to the docs to make it crystal clear.\r\n2. As for using the expand/collapse.  Yes, that is in general a good thing to show things.  However, it really only works well for very simple things.  Having very long scripts I think it a bit unwieldy.  As for the sample1d example, it shows all the various interpolators, so not sure if it is a great example of sample1d use, but I could be convinced.\r\n",
