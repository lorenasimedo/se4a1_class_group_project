Previously the header zmin and zmax were not reset prior to comparing to data values in the grid subregion, such that the min/max for the entire grid was always chosen.\r\n\r\nThere's still an additional issue where the region extracted for a virtual file might be offset by one row relative to the region extracted for an actual file, leading to a slight difference in the z-range:\r\n```\r\ngrdimage [INFORMATION]: Auto-stretching CPT file geo to fit data range -3893 to 3195.5\r\n\r\ngrdimage [INFORMATION]: Auto-stretching CPT file geo to fit data range -3824.5 to 3195.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe changes proposed and **why** you made them.
