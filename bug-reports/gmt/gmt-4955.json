It looks odd with the coarser gridlines than annotations, I think we usually see the opposite (denser gridlines, more spaced annotations.\r\n3.

The JV example is missing many annotations while the JN is not so bad I think (all lats are and longs are too crowded)\r\n> \r\n>     2. The JV example makes we wonder if the user sets a specific annotation interval we should not auto-compute tick and gridlines to exceed that spacing.  It looks odd with the coarser gridlines than annotations, I think we usually see the opposite (denser gridlines, more spaced annotations.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug. From the cookbook:\r\n\r\n_In the case of automatic spacing, when the stride argument is omitted after g, the grid line spacing is chosen the same as the minor tick spacing; unless g is used in consort with a, then the grid lines are spaced the same as the annotations._\r\n\r\nEdit: Perhaps I misunderstood that section. Regardless, I think if **g** is automatic with **a** or **f** custom, then it would be good to set **g** as equal to **a** or **f** (whichever is set). \r\n\r\n>     3. The -JN shows that ugly bump on the alignment for the 0 meridian.  I guess I thought we had set the extend ticks here so they would all be on the same horizontal line?\r\nThe annotations are stepped, it is most obvious for the 0 annotation. I agree it looks bad.\r\n<img width=\"791\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14077947/111054891-28a9fd80-843e-11eb-9d1f-243240888f0c.png\">\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "> The tick marks were always there but drowned by that over-thick frame. So more of a mini-bug than feature in my mind. I think ticks should be shown as they are in modern. If anyone wants to maintain that \"failure/feature\" they can shrink their tick lengths to match the frame width.\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation. One more question regarding the maps from the last comment. ``gmt_auto_frame_intervals`` is called independently on the x- and y- axes. Then, the *maximum* interval from those calls is used both for the x- and y- axes. Can you explain the motivation for having the interval be identical on both axes? This causes some limitations for maps that span great longitudes but short latitudes or vice versa (e.g., the equidistant conic example: https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.1/cookbook/map-projections.html#equidistant-conic-projection-jd-jd).\r\n\r\nHere is the example above if the auto-x and auto-y intervals are considered independently:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14077947/111684536-345e4100-87fd-11eb-8e4a-be20734a1e34.png)\r\n",
