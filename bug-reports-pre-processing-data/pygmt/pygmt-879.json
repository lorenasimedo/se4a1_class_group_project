On what should or should not be tested, see #796 and https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blame/a828f739057f6fd003d131063eab5e04df265540/CONTRIBUTING.md#L321-L325. Let's just say our standards have changed since PyGMT started in 2017, and there are some parts of our documentation from that early era (2018-2019) that have not been updated to the new standard (2021)! Which is why we need more eyes and contributors working on this!\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a better example of my confusion is [basemap](https://www.pygmt.org/dev/api/generated/pygmt.Figure.basemap.html#pygmt.Figure.basemap). **map_scale** and **rose** take really similar option flags and **map_scale** lists a subset of the flags from basemap **-L** whereas rose does not list any flags from basemap **-T**. Still, **map_scale** does not list all the option flags from basemap **-L** and likely wouldn't work with only '[g|j|J|n|x]refpoint'.\r\n\r\nFair point. the `basemap` is certainly a priority to document properly since it is one of the more commonly used functions. We had some PRs dedicated to completing the documentation of some functions (e.g. #799, #676, etc), I'd encourage you to take a look at those PRs to see how wrapping new aliases can be done.",
