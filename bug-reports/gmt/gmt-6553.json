    "body": "This PR uncortunately does three very different things; I was too lazy to break the commits up...\r\n\r\n1. Fix usage of _gmt_access_. This general function returns nonzero if there are problems finding the given file.  However, it already does a few other things:\r\n\r\n- If file is a memory file it returns 0 since memory is there\r\n- If file is a cache file then it will first check if we should download it\r\n\r\nHence, there are no points checking both for access and if cache or memory file in various places since _gmt_access_ handles this.  \r\n\r\n2. Let _gmtplot_flush_symbol_piece_ be more specific and just set flush to false and return if there are no lines. \r\n\r\n3. Fix _gmtapi_extract_argument_ for the colon options.  Needed a special section to handle the quoted, decorated, or contoured line settings where (after stripping of any colon args) we know exactly what to do. With this the -S~f works for me in Julia.\r\n\r\n4. Remove an unused variable.\r\n\r\nCloses #6551.",

In may cases we simply leave off the name when providing data from the external.  So how would -Sk/size work in the parser?  This needs to be -Sk?/size at some point.  Likewise,` -S~f:sk/0.2c` will need to become` -S~f?:sk?/0.2c` which is something we have not had before...\r\n- \r\n\r\nI think this may be one of those cases where it is just simpler to write whatever memory symbol you have to a temp file...\r\n",
