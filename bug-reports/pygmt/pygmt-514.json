Nevertheless, there is still a problem when calling shift origin with values of zero before creating the first image.

Even when you append `r` to force this to be a relative shift, shift_origin performs an absolute shift.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as I know, the current origin of the first plot is not (0, 0), but is rather shifted a small amount (0+dx, 0+dy) so that the labels aren't cropped.

In classic mode, the dx and dy are 72 points (i.e., 1 inch). In modern mode, I believe they're 5 inches.\r\n\r\nThe three figures you shown are expected from GMT CLI. \r\n\r\nFor GMT, the first plotting command is very special. If no **-X** and **-Y** are used, the default origin is (72p, 72p). You can think that **-Xr1i** and **-Yr1i** are automatically added to the first plotting command in this case. However, if you gives **-X** and/or **-Y** in the first plotting command, they override the default values. So your **-Xr0i** and **-Yr0i** actually put the plot origin at (0,0), and the left and bottom labels are all cropped. \r\n\r\nThis is how GMT does for a long time. PyGMT can do nothing here, because PyGMT don't know if this is the first plotting command or not (although maybe we can add the counter). I'm not sure what GMT can do without backward incompatibility. @PaulWessel ",

With modern mode we basically have no paper size (but it is there, just limited to 11x11 meters by ghostscript) and we decided to let the origin be at (5i,5i) to ensure no surprises.  But even that is not foolproof.  If you make your first plot and then move negatively down/left you will eventually hit the paper edge, and 5 inches is not particularly large if you are thinking in terms of paper dimensions.  Perhaps we should use (1m,1m) instead so any surprise would only affect people making plots that are several meters in dimensions.  We also had trouble with various bugs in ghostscript that defeated our margin settings but I think we are past that now.  I think the GMT developers should consider setting that margin to (1m,1m).",

Those are the defaults.

We dealt with many of those breaks by introducing modern mode.\r\n\r\nOk. I think I understand what is happening. For the first plot, the default origin is set to (0,0). Then, if you don't specify `-X` and `-Y` (which you probably wouldn't under normal circumstances) the values of `-Xr72p -Yr72p` are passed in order to shift the plot origin to (72p, 72p).\r\n\r\nMy mistake was thinking that the default origin of the first plot was set to (72p, 72p), and that by specifying `-Xr0` nothing would happen as there would be a 0p relative shift with respect to (72p, 72p).\r\n\r\nLet me stress that this issue is *not* important to me! Nevertheless, one potential way to clarify things might be to (1) set the default origin to (72p, 72p), and (2) not to pass `-Xr72p -Yr72p` as default values for the first plot. Please don't waste your time on this unless you think it is important :)\r\n\r\n",
