    "body": "The soon-to-be-updated _srtm_tiles.nc_ (attached) now has three values: 0 means no SRTM data for this 1x1 tile, 1 if there is data but tile is partially in the ocean, and 2 if data and fully on land.  Previously, we only have values 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a file but we had no way of knowing if ocean filler would be needed, so we had to add `@earth_relief_15s` tiles no matter what, even if the region was entirely on land.  Because of the need for backwards compatibility, the new file should work well with GMT 6.2 and earlier since the check was only on whether of not a node was zero or not.  For 6.3 it will now be able to distinguish complete land tiles from mixed tiles.  This PR also adds a few more checks, such as\r\n\r\n- Allowing for a future tile coverage grid to not be forced to be 0/360 by considering possible 360-wrapping\r\n- Add a few named enums to make the code easier to read\r\n\r\nAfter a minor fix to GMT_SRTM.sh doc script (just letting both 1 and 2 be red) this passes all the tests, as well as solves #5876.  However, we should make sure it also works the same as before with GMT 6.2.\r\n\r\n@meghanrjones, would you be able to move your ~/.gmt/cache/srtm_tiles.nc file to somewhere else and install the attached on instead, then run all the tests with GMT 6.2.0 version?\r\n\r\n[srtm_tiles.nc.zip](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/files/7377672/srtm_tiles.nc.zip)\r\n\r\nOnce that passes then we can remove the WIP and approve/merge.\r\n\r\n",
