But I encountered the following problems:\r\n1. The angle was treated as longitude by default rather than latitude, so the suffix was W or E. \r\n2. The options **+l**_label_ and  **+u**_unit_ didn't work under the projection with polar coordinates `-JP`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please be as detailed as you can when describing an issue.
