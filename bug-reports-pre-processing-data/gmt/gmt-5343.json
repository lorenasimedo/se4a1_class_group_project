            "body": "So this is classic rounding behavior.  If we use the _pshistogram_get_bin_ function that assumes the bins have a fixed interval we do things like `bin = (int64_t)floor ((x - T->min) / T->inc)` and this may give 7.99999999 and return 7.  If we used the function that thinks it is not equidistant we basically loop and compare x to the array bounds and that gives the more consistent result.  The reason is that the array[] values are all flawed in the same way as the input since 8 cannot be represented, only 7.999999, so we \"floor\" to the _same_ side each time.  With the division we are creating a new floating point that varies every other bin, either giving k.9999999999 or (k+1).0000000001111.\r\nPerhaps the simplest solution here is to not fall into the rounding trap by using the _pshistogram_get_variable_bin_ function.  However, this is also bad user behavior trying to bin data that all fall on the bin boundaries exactly.  This is what **-F** is for. \r\nI remember last year we had some discussions regarding histogram with @joa-quim regarding speed.  The division is obviously faster than searching the array unless the data are already relatively sorted.    Maybe instead of \r\n\r\n`pshistogram_get_bin = (F->T->var_inc) ? &pshistogram_get_variable_bin : &pshistogram_get_constant_bin;`\r\n\r\nwe should do\r\n\r\n`pshistogram_get_bin = (F->T->var_inc || n < BIG_NUMBER) ? &pshistogram_get_variable_bin : &pshistogram_get_constant_bin;`\r\n\r\nmeaning we only encounter the rounding for very large data sets?  Say BIG_NUMBER is 10e6?\r\n",
