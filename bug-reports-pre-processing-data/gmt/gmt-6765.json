It turns out that that the grids in question have no **actual_range** but oddly the report is that ``v_min`` and ``v_max`` are zero. Not ``z_min``, ``z_max``.\r\n\r\nExample grid can be downloaded from [here](https://cloud.marum.de/s/Yjqyws5BiFbJco3/download?path=%2F&files=gebco_2021_n35.50506591796875_s31.96197509765625_w22.9449462890625_e27.2021484375.nc&downloadStartSecret=c78i9e62nkq)\r\n\r\nSo shamelessly GEBCO is not setting the ``actual_range`` attribute and calls ``elevation`` to the ``z`` array.

The standard even says: \"Optionally, the vertical type may be indicated additionally by providing the standard_name attribute with an appropriate value, and/or the axis attribute with the value Z.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.9/cf-conventions.html#vertical-coordinate\r\n\r\nTo me sounds that a grid to be fully compliant with the CF Convention should use V over Z.\r\n\r\nAlso, if GMT is able to recognise these grids as COARDS, CF-1.5 (under the IDs nb, ns, ni, nf and nd), the same standard was already there in 2010 (link bellow).\r\n\r\nhttp://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.5/build/cf-conventions.html#vertical-coordinate\r\n\r\nTherefore I presume that the use of -M inside grdinfo could perhaps be standard when files are recognised by GMT as COARDS, CF-1.5 (or later), isn't? What are the drawbacks of enabling -M as default for the IDs nb, ns, ni, nf and nd inside GMT?",

Looks to me whatever tool wrote this subset did not save the range of this subset's values.  I am not sure we want to force GMT to always read the entire grid file if there is no info on the range since many uses of grdinfo has nothing to do with the range of the data.  But we can have a discussion on this of course.  For instance, if there is no info on the range, perhaps we should turn on -M unless some other option has been selected that implies we do not need the z-range.  And if we had parsed the geospatial_vertical attributes we would have returned the wrong range.\r\n",

Dave and I will start testing it and work to adapt the MB-System scripts to the new grdinfo.\r\n\r\nPS: I have a few people I know at GEBCO and EMODNET (that seam to care a lot about data quality and compliance to standards) I know and I can report that their grids are written wrong. I don't know if that will produce improvements but I was puzzled that the netCDF grids from these two large entities that was supposed to target GMT users were not GMT/netCDF compatible. But I experienced already that with some crazy netCDF files from Ifremer where everything was scrabbled in GMT, so I used the ESRI ASCII grids that were written properly. I will also contact the CF Convention committee and suggest build a quick test suite to check netCDF grid compliance to CF Conventions, and help spot these mishandling of the standard. Maybe with that would not be always on us to adapt our software to read broken grids.",
