    "body": "See #6487 for background and example.  Sometime during the recoding from GMT4 to GMT 5 we (meaning me) introduced a bug that only affected **grdpaste**.  The way **grdpaste** works is to set a data offset parameter in the hidden grid header section so that when we read in data we consider if the hidden data_offset is nonzero (well, we basically always offset the start of the grid by that amount, zero or not).  Thus data are read twice by **grdpaste** into the same array but at two different starting positions.  This works fine.\r\n\r\nThe trouble had to do with input grids that have scale factors or offsets that are _not_ the default (1, 0).  Turned out the code that does the unpacking was not made aware of the data offset and hence only the first part of the combined grid would have scaling applied.\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the offset immediately at the top of the highest level _gmtlib_read_grd_ function and then all subsequent function calls dealing with the grid (such as finding min/max or unpacking) do not need to consider any offsets.  The example discussed in the background now works fine.  Closes #6487.\r\n",
