If you don't know where to start, let us know and we'll walk you through it.\n* All new features should be documented. It helps to write the docstrings for your functions/classes before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.\n* No matter what, we are really grateful that you put in the effort to do this! \ud83c\udf89\n",
