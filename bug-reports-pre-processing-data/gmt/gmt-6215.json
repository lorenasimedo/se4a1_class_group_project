    "body": "See #6213 for background.  This PR does a few things and raises a question (at the end):\r\n\r\n1. We adjust the center of the rose coordinate by the label offset amount that have been selected.\r\n2. We use PSL to determine the exact width and height of the label (if specified) to transform the origin by the amount.\r\n\r\nThis addresses the main concern in #6213.  The PR does a few more things for modern mode:\r\n\r\n1. It sets the label font size to 25% of the rose diameter.\r\n2. It sets the label offset (gap between rose thorns and text) to be 50% of the label size.\r\n\r\nBoth of those fractions are up for discussion and refinement.  Also, the classic defaults for font size (**FONT_TITLE**) and offset (**MAP_TITLE_OFFSET** for fancy and (curiously) **MAP_ANNOT_OFFSET** for plain) are much too large and furthermore inconsistent.  We could either declare a bug here or just keep the auto-scaling to modern mode in line with other auto-scalings. \r\n\r\nHappy to take comments on this.  Below is a new test.  There is one tiny issue remaining: The S label is still clipped and I cannot yet see why this can happen...\r\n\r\n![roses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/149036937-78d42c77-c632-46bc-b0ff-6573010206aa.png)\r\n",

            "body": "For oblique projections, the N arrow is not parallel to the meridians.... This messes up the justification and offset of the oblique N arrow.  I have tried to tackle this.  For the fancy star it is not an issue since it is sort of like a circle.  The plain N arrow with cross and circle is more of a rectangle, with the width = 0.5 height.  This was not even adjusted for in master.  I  have fixed that but also tried to tackle the justification for arbitrary angle.  Because of the letter N at the end of the arrow it is nontrivial to do it perfectly.  This comes close enough for government work I hope.  See what you think as the movie below loops through all 360 degrees (a fakery).  The red lines indicate the requested offset from the map frame.For the common case of N straight up I can do exact in PostScript.  Let me know if @joa-quim, @Esteban82 and @meghanrjones are happy with this improvement before I merge my changes into this branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/150436735-6da85514-7808-4fa3-ac24-959661c4f4a7.mp4\r\n\r\nOther questions:\r\n\r\n1. The fancy rose: Shall we flip the text angles when things go upside down? (Fortunately not an issue for N in the plain rose!)\r\n2. DO you think the label offset between arrow and N is too big? It ought to be the same as in the fancy but it looks bigger.\r\n3. ???",

I prefer not to make this branch more complicated that it already is so those items can be tackled after this one has been approved.  Here is a summary what this branch does:\r\n\r\n1. Sets default values for the size of map roses: 10% for directional rose and 15% for magnetic rose of max map dimension.\r\n2. Allows sizes of roses to be specified in percent of max map dimension (in addition to regular plot units).\r\n3. Adds **MAP_EMBELLISHMENT_MODE** = auto|manual to the mix.  FYI @joa-quim, the decision on how this affects classic will be _deferred_ until all the embellishment updates and bug fixes are completed so I know the full picture.  For now, classic has this set to manual so that users of master and classic wont have to deal with changes back and forth until we finalize it.\r\n4. Add **+F** to complement **+f** for fancy directional rose, which ensures label baselines are in the \u00b190 range [Default rotates with projection]\r\n5. Auto-compute map rose offsets for **MAP_EMBELLISHMENT_MODE** = auto when **+o** not set, to 10% of size.\r\n6. For smaller magnetic roses (size < 2.5 cm) the auto-default for **+t** is changed from 30/5/1/30/5/1 to 90/30/3/45/15/3.\r\n7. Justification for the rectangular-shaped plain N-arrow symbol is not perfectly justified and fit using _PostScript_ computations regardless of map projection rotations of North [see movie above].\r\n\r\nTwo new tests highlights the improved justification where labels no longer exceeds the bounds (_dir_roses.sh_ and _mag_roses.sh_).  I have not uploaded PS files for these or the examples and scripts that now \"fail\" in a good way.\r\n\r\nI know @Esteban82 just approved as I was typing up this comment, so please have a look and I think I would also like to hear from @meghanrjones and @joa-quim on this before merging anything.  I do need this eventually merged so I can tackle the bugs in **-F**.",

I think that a user should not need to set both MAP_EMBELLISHMENT_MODE=manual and FONT_TITLE=9p for their font preference to be applied, since they may prefer auto offset with a specific font size or already have scripts in modern mode with a specific font size. For example, the relevant line in `GMT_obl_nz.sh` sets ``--FONT_TITLE=9p`` but this does not affect the plot in this PR.\r\n",

The solution is to temporarily reset the PostScript matrix projection, compute the offsets, then reinstate the projection (the -p60/30 as implemented in PostScript) as the offsets need to be measured without perspective.  Now, ex04 has a good default placement and size I think.  About 8 tests related to map roses, including some new tests with no PS files, fail.  I think we will add these to dvc soon.",
