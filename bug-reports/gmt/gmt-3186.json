    "body": "And update two PS files. We had wrong parameters being passed into the local function _grdvolume_NE_triangle_.  Here, we pass two lines y0(x) = ax +b and y1(x) = cx + d.  For a NE triangle the a and b are computed from a sloping line, but y1 is the top of the square, so c = 0 and d = 1.  Unfortunately, we passed c = d = 0 and hence all NE triangles were wrong.  Because this error only affects a small part of the volume near a contour where we have a NE triangle it is not easy to notice.  However, I created a grid with a bilinear surface so the analytical volume is known, and then I added a new **-D** option (another PR) that computed incremental slice volumes.  I noticed that near some contours the slice volume was negative, which cannot happen.  Detailed debugging lead to the discovery of this but.  Now the results are correct (the integrals were checked and are all correct).  The bug affected two scripts whose volumes were slightly off.",
