    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nExternal programs like PyGMT can pass dataset/momory to GMT. By default,\r\nGMT can read, modify and free the momery, which sometimes can cause\r\ncrashes.\r\n\r\nIssue #406 reports an example in which PyGMT crashes. The issue was reported\r\nto the upstream (see https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/issues/3515\r\nand https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/pull/3528). It turns out\r\nto be an API user error (i.e., a PyGMT bug).\r\n\r\nAs per the explanation of Paul, external programs like PyGMT should\r\nalways use `GMT_IN|GMT_IS_REFERENCE` to tell GMT that the data is\r\nread-only, so that GMT won't try to change and free the memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the change from `GMT_IN` to `GMT_IN|GMT_IS_REFERENCE`\r\nin the `Session.open_virtual_file()` function, updates a few docstrings,\r\nand also adds the script in #406 as a test.\r\n\r\nFixes #406. \r\n\r\nGMT C API references: https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/api.html#resource-registration\r\n\r\n**Reminders**\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `make format` and `make check` to make sure the code follows the style guide.\r\n- [x] Add tests for new features or tests that would have caught the bug that you're fixing.\r\n- [ ] Add new public functions/methods/classes to `doc/api/index.rst`.\r\n- [ ] Write detailed docstrings for all functions/methods.\r\n- [ ] If adding new functionality, add an example to docstrings or tutorials.\r\n",
