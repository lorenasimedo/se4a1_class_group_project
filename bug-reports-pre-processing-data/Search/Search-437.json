Only in the 14th\r\ncentury Europe, around 25 million out of about 100 million individuals died from\r\nthe Black Death [1]. Several diseases were discovered in America which included\r\nsmallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus, whooping cough, the mumps, and\r\ndiphtheria. Infectious disease was the main reason for the demise of the Indians\r\n[2]. In the early 1980\u2019s, some homosexual men in the United States were\r\ndiagnosed with a type of fungal infection and a tumor called Candidiasis and\r\nKaposi\u2019s sarcoma respectively. Paris Pasteur institute in 1984 detected a virus\r\nresponsible for those diseases and called it the Human Immunodeficiency Virus\r\n(HIV) [3].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nHIV is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The\r\nvirus is responsible for attacking and destroying the immune systems mainly the\r\nCD4+ T-lymphocytes or T-cells [1]. On a normal basis, these CD4+ T-lymphocytes\r\nor T-cells detect foreign and infected cells, and attack, spread and kill them\r\n[1\u20133]. HIV is able to infect CD4+ T-lymphocytes and insert its genome to host\r\ngenome. This integrated HIV genome may exist in 2 states. They can be either\r\ntranscriptionally active generating new viruses that can infect other CD4+\r\nT-lymphocytes or in latent state which may become activated later. In\r\ntranscriptionally active stage, the infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes die due to\r\ncytopathic effect of the virus. As a result, the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes,\r\nwhich are able to recognize foreign and infected cells, declines, and this\r\ndecrement lead stoper manent and lasting damage to the immune system [3]. The\r\nimmune system finally loses its ability to fight and kill infections due to the\r\nnumber of CD4+ T-lymphocytes count which is so small. When an individual reaches\r\nthis stage, the person is said to have AIDS [4]. The time between getting\r\ninfected with HIV and advancing to AIDS is, in general, five years but changes\r\ndue to many factors. If the CD4+ T-lymphocytes cells count falls below\r\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\r\n\\usepackage{amsmath}                                 \\usepackage{wasysym}\r\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}                                  \\usepackage{amssymb}\r\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}                                 \\usepackage{mathrsfs}\r\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\r\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\r\n\\begin{document}$$ 200\\, \\text{cells/mm}^{\\text{3}}\r\n$$\\end{document}200cells/mm3, then the person is considered to be in the \u201cAIDS\r\nphase\u201d, otherwise the person is said to be HIV infected [5]. The mode of\r\ntransmission of HIV includes heterosexual intercourse, homosexual/bisexual\r\nintercourse, intravenous drug use, vertical transmission, and unknown reasons\r\n[6].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSince its discovery (HIV/AIDS), the extensive increase and epidemic continues\r\naround the globe. The greatest number in any one year was in 2003, where almost\r\nfive million individuals became newly infected, with a total of 38 million\r\nHIV/AIDS patients, and almost three million people died from AIDS in the same\r\nyear [7]. To continue its record of one of the most destructive epidemics in\r\nhistory, it killed at least 25 million people by 2005. Efforts to improve the\r\nuse of antiretroviral treatment in some part of the world were still not enough\r\nto reduce a significant number of deaths, the HIV/AIDS epidemic claimed 3.1\r\nmillion lives in 2005, of which about 570000 were children (UNAIDS/WHO [8]).\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe region that suffered most is Africa, with Sub-Saharan Africa as the home of\r\nthe epidemic. In 2010, 2.7 million people were newly infected, and 1.8 million\r\npatients died of AIDS-related causes across the globe. By the end of 2010,\r\naround 34 million individuals were victims of HIV/AIDS [9]. China stated that\r\nabout 2.8 million died of AIDS-related causes in 2011, and there were about 7.8\r\nmillion HIV-infected individuals by the end of 2011. In the year 1985, two\r\npatients were diagnosed with AIDS in Turkey, since then, the importance of AIDS\r\nstarted and still continue to be on the forefront. The number of new cases\r\nincreases every year, with 34, 91, and 119 cases in 1990, 1995, and 1999\r\nrespectively [10].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn 2004, the Ministry of Health (MOH) published the total number of HIV patients\r\n1802, of which 76% are between the ages of 15 to 49 years and sexually active.\r\nAmong these patients, about 800 were AIDS patients. This is an official data\r\nfrom MOH, however, these numbers does not reflect the actual figures of HIV\r\ninfected individual in Turkey, due to insufficiency of the registration system,\r\nand the lack awareness and phobia of the patients to attend health centers or\r\nhospitals [11].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nAt the end of 2011, the ministry stated that the total number of HIV/AIDS\r\ninfected people was 5224. It also published in 2013 that at least 6000\r\nindividuals were infected with HIV, and the numbers of newly reported cases in\r\n2010, 2011, and first six months of 2013 were 589, 1068, and 587 respectively.\r\nAccording to a report, poor knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases, poor\r\nsocio-economic conditions, increase in number of unregistered sex workers,\r\nincrease in number of homosexuals, and intravenous drug use contributed to the\r\nspread of HIV infection in Turkey. It was reported that, the main way of\r\ntransmitting HIV in Turkey is via heterosexual sex (53%), then men having sex\r\nwith men (MSM at 9%), and intravenous drug users (IDU at 3%) among the recorded\r\ncases. According to Positive Living Association Istanbul, personal\r\ncommunication, HIV/AIDS will become a major public health issue in Turkey in the\r\ncoming years, as such; it must be regarded as a rising disease for Turkey [12].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe main ways in which HIV/AIDS is transmitted between individuals are now well\r\nunderstood, but the factors that contribute to the disparities in its prevalence\r\nand trends among populations remain an area of interest to scientific\r\nresearchers. To understand these disparities, it is essential to understand the\r\nsystem, its components and its dynamics. Mathematical models of HIV/AIDS\r\ntransmission dynamics are important research tool in this category [13, 14].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nPrimary purpose of any mathematical model of HIV transmission lies in using\r\nindividual level inputs to project population level outcomes. Some of the\r\nimportant outcomes that can be examined with a model are; the incidence of\r\ninfection, the prevalence of infection, or the doubling time of the epidemic.\r\nMore important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to\r\noccur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of\r\ninfection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic:\r\nthe reproduction number of the infectious process, R0. In a susceptible\r\npopulation, R0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated\r\nby the first infected individual. If R0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic\r\nis expected. If R0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out [15].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe magnitude of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\r\n\\usepackage{amsmath}                                 \\usepackage{wasysym}\r\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}                                  \\usepackage{amssymb}\r\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}                                 \\usepackage{mathrsfs}\r\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\r\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\r\n\\begin{document}$$ R_{0} $$\\end{document}R0 is used to measure the risk of an\r\nepidemic or pandemic in any emerging infectious disease.

Tropical issues such as the\r\nrisks of indoor airborne infection, bioterrorism, and computer viruses also\r\ndepend on this important parameter [23\u201326].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn this paper, we shall first introduce the model involving systems of ODE, and\r\nthen discuss the biological meaning of the parameters involved. We shall study\r\nthe global stabilities of both disease free and endemic equilibria by the use of\r\nLyapunov function. By the use of real data obtained from Turkey in 2016, we will\r\nconduct numerical simulations to support the analytic result.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In Sect.\u00a02, the model is presented\r\nand the basic reproduction number is obtained. In Sect.\u00a03, stability of the\r\nequilibria are investigated. In Sect.\u00a04, results are obtained by numerical\r\nsimulations of the real data obtained from Turkey in 2016. Finally Sect.\u00a05 is\r\nthe discussion and conclusion of the research.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the Model\r\nThe system of ordinary differential equations derived is for the whole Turkish\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nSusceptibles, S(t)\r\nConsider the birth \u039b(t) to the susceptible population per unit time.\r\nSusceptibles individuals are removed through infection or through natural death.\r\nLet \u00b5 be the natural death rate for the whole population. The removal rate of\r\nsusceptible individuals through infection is the number of new HIV infections\r\nper unit time. We use this rate in calculating HIV incidence which by definition\r\nis the number of new infected persons in a specified period of time divided by\r\nthe number of uninfected persons that were exposed for this same time.\r\n\r\nHIV Positives, H(t)\r\nLet each susceptible have c contacts per unit time. Assume that a proportion H/N\r\nof these contacts are with infectives and at each of these contacts with\r\ninfectives, a susceptible has a probability b of becoming infected. Let \u03b1 the\r\nincidence rate, then the total probability of one susceptible getting HIV\r\ninfected from any of their contacts per unit time is \u03b1H/N. This is the\r\nexpression for the force of infection. The force of infection is the probability\r\nthat a susceptible will get an HIV infection per unit time. Therefore in a\r\npopulation of S susceptibles, the number of new HIV infections per unit time is\r\ngiven by \u03b1HS/N. Infectives are recruited through new HIV infections described\r\nabove and removed through death at rate v and through natural death at rate \u00b5.\r\nHence, 1/v is the duration spent in the infective stage and 1/\u00b5 is the life\r\nexpectancy of the population. All these rates are assumed constant in the model.\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nRemoved cases are recruited either through natural death \u03bc or through deaths due\r\nto HIV at the rate v.\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nWith these assumptions, we arrive at the following system of\r\nODE.\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\r\n\\usepackage{amsmath}                                 \\usepackage{wasysym}\r\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}                                  \\usepackage{amssymb}\r\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}                                 \\usepackage{mathrsfs}\r\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\r\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\r\n\\begin{document}$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\varLambda -

Also, if the value is greater than or equals to\r\none the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe Turkish population in the year 2016 is 79814871, and the HIV positive\r\npopulation is 13646. The value of the basic reproduction ratio is 1.98998, which\r\nis bigger than one. This implies one HIV positive individual in Turkey can be\r\nable to transfer the disease to almost 2 individuals, hence there is going to be\r\nHIV epidemic in Turkey.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nNumerical simulations were carried out and the results support the analytic\r\nfindings. The results in the simulation shows that if appropriate measures are\r\nnot taken, in 50 years to come, there will be more HIV positive individuals in\r\nTurkey as there are susceptible individuals.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe main limitation to our analysis may be that we did not account for the\r\neffect of behavioral change arising both from number of HIV cases in the\r\ncommunity as well as awareness by governmental and nongovernmental\r\norganizations. Secondary, the possible effects of extensive use of\r\nantiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in terms of method of distributing drugs through\r\npublic or private health institution or a combination of both could determine\r\nwhether patients on ARVs revert back to the infective class. This together with\r\nreduced infectiousness due to lower viral loads for those on treatment was not\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nDespite the limitations mentioned above, there are several implications of our\r\nfindings to public health. First, the endemic equilibrium should be brought as\r\nlow as possible especially during the first wave of the epidemic. This model\r\nsuggests that this can be achieved by prolonging the lifetime of the HIV\r\npatients for as long as possible. Second, HIV prevalence at low prevalence\r\nlevels become less sensitive to changes in the dynamics of HIV epidemic because\r\nit is overpowered by demographic changes especially the recruitment of\r\nsusceptibles. At low prevalence levels, there is hence need to track trends in\r\nnumber of persons infected with HIV than tracking HIV prevalence.\r\n\r\nFigure Caption\r\nDynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey\r\n\r\nTable Caption\r\nModel parameters as calculated from the data\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>On this branch</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nIntroduction\r\nHistorically, infectious diseases posed a real threat to the human population.\r\nAlthough they have been in human population all the time to some extent, the\r\neffects of epidemics are the most obvious and noticeable. Only in the 14th\r\ncentury Europe, around 25 million out of about 100 million individuals died from\r\nthe Black Death [1]. Several diseases were discovered in America which included\r\nsmallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus, whooping cough, the mumps, and\r\ndiphtheria. Infectious disease was the main reason for the demise of the Indians\r\n[2]. In the early 1980\u2019s, some homosexual men in the United States were\r\ndiagnosed with a type of fungal infection and a tumor called Candidiasis and\r\nKaposi\u2019s sarcoma respectively. Paris Pasteur institute in 1984 detected a virus\r\nresponsible for those diseases and called it the Human Immunodeficiency Virus\r\n(HIV) [3].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nHIV is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The\r\nvirus is responsible for attacking and destroying the immune systems mainly the\r\nCD4+ T-lymphocytes or T-cells [1]. On a normal basis, these CD4+ T-lymphocytes\r\nor T-cells detect foreign and infected cells, and attack, spread and kill them\r\n[1\u20133]. HIV is able to infect CD4+ T-lymphocytes and insert its genome to host\r\ngenome. This integrated HIV genome may exist in 2 states. They can be either\r\ntranscriptionally active generating new viruses that can infect other CD4+\r\nT-lymphocytes or in latent state which may become activated later. In\r\ntranscriptionally active stage, the infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes die due to\r\ncytopathic effect of the virus. As a result, the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes,\r\nwhich are able to recognize foreign and infected cells, declines, and this\r\ndecrement lead stoper manent and lasting damage to the immune system [3]. The\r\nimmune system finally loses its ability to fight and kill infections due to the\r\nnumber of CD4+ T-lymphocytes count which is so small. When an individual reaches\r\nthis stage, the person is said to have AIDS [4]. The time between getting\r\ninfected with HIV and advancing to AIDS is, in general, five years but changes\r\ndue to many factors. If the CD4+ T-lymphocytes cells count falls below FORMULA,\r\nthen the person is considered to be in the \u201cAIDS phase\u201d, otherwise the person is\r\nsaid to be HIV infected [5]. The mode of transmission of HIV includes\r\nheterosexual intercourse, homosexual/bisexual intercourse, intravenous drug use,\r\nvertical transmission, and unknown reasons [6].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSince its discovery (HIV/AIDS), the extensive increase and epidemic continues\r\naround the globe. The greatest number in any one year was in 2003, where almost\r\nfive million individuals became newly infected, with a total of 38 million\r\nHIV/AIDS patients, and almost three million people died from AIDS in the same\r\nyear [7]. To continue its record of one of the most destructive epidemics in\r\nhistory, it killed at least 25 million people by 2005. Efforts to improve the\r\nuse of antiretroviral treatment in some part of the world were still not enough\r\nto reduce a significant number of deaths, the HIV/AIDS epidemic claimed 3.1\r\nmillion lives in 2005, of which about 570000 were children (UNAIDS/WHO [8]).\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe region that suffered most is Africa, with Sub-Saharan Africa as the home of\r\nthe epidemic. In 2010, 2.7 million people were newly infected, and 1.8 million\r\npatients died of AIDS-related causes across the globe. By the end of 2010,\r\naround 34 million individuals were victims of HIV/AIDS [9]. China stated that\r\nabout 2.8 million died of AIDS-related causes in 2011, and there were about 7.8\r\nmillion HIV-infected individuals by the end of 2011. In the year 1985, two\r\npatients were diagnosed with AIDS in Turkey, since then, the importance of AIDS\r\nstarted and still continue to be on the forefront. The number of new cases\r\nincreases every year, with 34, 91, and 119 cases in 1990, 1995, and 1999\r\nrespectively [10].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn 2004, the Ministry of Health (MOH) published the total number of HIV patients\r\n1802, of which 76% are between the ages of 15 to 49 years and sexually active.\r\nAmong these patients, about 800 were AIDS patients. This is an official data\r\nfrom MOH, however, these numbers does not reflect the actual figures of HIV\r\ninfected individual in Turkey, due to insufficiency of the registration system,\r\nand the lack awareness and phobia of the patients to attend health centers or\r\nhospitals [11].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nAt the end of 2011, the ministry stated that the total number of HIV/AIDS\r\ninfected people was 5224. It also published in 2013 that at least 6000\r\nindividuals were infected with HIV, and the numbers of newly reported cases in\r\n2010, 2011, and first six months of 2013 were 589, 1068, and 587 respectively.\r\nAccording to a report, poor knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases, poor\r\nsocio-economic conditions, increase in number of unregistered sex workers,\r\nincrease in number of homosexuals, and intravenous drug use contributed to the\r\nspread of HIV infection in Turkey. It was reported that, the main way of\r\ntransmitting HIV in Turkey is via heterosexual sex (53%), then men having sex\r\nwith men (MSM at 9%), and intravenous drug users (IDU at 3%) among the recorded\r\ncases. According to Positive Living Association Istanbul, personal\r\ncommunication, HIV/AIDS will become a major public health issue in Turkey in the\r\ncoming years, as such; it must be regarded as a rising disease for Turkey [12].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe main ways in which HIV/AIDS is transmitted between individuals are now well\r\nunderstood, but the factors that contribute to the disparities in its prevalence\r\nand trends among populations remain an area of interest to scientific\r\nresearchers. To understand these disparities, it is essential to understand the\r\nsystem, its components and its dynamics. Mathematical models of HIV/AIDS\r\ntransmission dynamics are important research tool in this category [13, 14].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nPrimary purpose of any mathematical model of HIV transmission lies in using\r\nindividual level inputs to project population level outcomes. Some of the\r\nimportant outcomes that can be examined with a model are; the incidence of\r\ninfection, the prevalence of infection, or the doubling time of the epidemic.\r\nMore important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to\r\noccur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of\r\ninfection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic:\r\nthe reproduction number of the infectious process, R_0. In a susceptible\r\npopulation, R_0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated\r\nby the first infected individual. If R_0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic\r\nis expected. If R_0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out [15].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe magnitude of FORMULA is used to measure the risk of an epidemic or pandemic\r\nin any emerging infectious disease. It was used for understanding the outbreak\r\nand danger of SARS. FORMULA was also used to characterize bovine spongiform\r\nencephalitis (BSE), foot and mouth disease (FMD), strains of influenza, and West\r\nNile Virus [16\u201319]. The incidence and spread of dengue, Ebola, and scrapie have\r\nalso been assessed by FORMULA [20\u201322]. Tropical issues such as the risks of\r\nindoor airborne infection, bioterrorism, and computer viruses also depend on\r\nthis important parameter [23\u201326].\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn this paper, we shall first introduce the model involving systems of ODE, and\r\nthen discuss the biological meaning of the parameters involved. We shall study\r\nthe global stabilities of both disease free and endemic equilibria by the use of\r\nLyapunov function. By the use of real data obtained from Turkey in 2016, we will\r\nconduct numerical simulations to support the analytic result.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: In Sect.\u00a02, the model is presented\r\nand the basic reproduction number is obtained. In Sect.\u00a03, stability of the\r\nequilibria are investigated. In Sect.\u00a04, results are obtained by numerical\r\nsimulations of the real data obtained from Turkey in 2016. Finally Sect.\u00a05 is\r\nthe discussion and conclusion of the research.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the Model\r\nThe system of ordinary differential equations derived is for the whole Turkish\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nSusceptibles, S(t)\r\nConsider the birth \u039b(t) to the susceptible population per unit time.\r\nSusceptibles individuals are removed through infection or through natural death.\r\nLet \u00b5 be the natural death rate for the whole population. The removal rate of\r\nsusceptible individuals through infection is the number of new HIV infections\r\nper unit time. We use this rate in calculating HIV incidence which by definition\r\nis the number of new infected persons in a specified period of time divided by\r\nthe number of uninfected persons that were exposed for this same time.\r\n\r\nHIV Positives, H(t)\r\nLet each susceptible have c contacts per unit time. Assume that a proportion H/N\r\nof these contacts are with infectives and at each of these contacts with\r\ninfectives, a susceptible has a probability b of becoming infected. Let \u03b1 the\r\nincidence rate, then the total probability of one susceptible getting HIV\r\ninfected from any of their contacts per unit time is \u03b1H/N. This is the\r\nexpression for the force of infection. The force of infection is the probability\r\nthat a susceptible will get an HIV infection per unit time. Therefore in a\r\npopulation of S susceptibles, the number of new HIV infections per unit time is\r\ngiven by \u03b1HS/N. Infectives are recruited through new HIV infections described\r\nabove and removed through death at rate v and through natural death at rate \u00b5.\r\nHence, 1/v is the duration spent in the infective stage and 1/\u00b5 is the life\r\nexpectancy of the population. All these rates are assumed constant in the model.\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nRemoved cases are recruited either through natural death \u03bc or through deaths due\r\nto HIV at the rate v.\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nWith these assumptions, we arrive at the following system of ODE. FORMULA-BLOCK\r\nFORMULA-BLOCK  FORMULA-BLOCK  FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nSince FORMULA, then Eq.\u00a0(1) can be reduced to FORMULA-BLOCK  FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nIt follows from (1) that, FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nThen FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nRemoved Phase, R(t)\r\nThus the feasible region for (1) is FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nMore Assumptions\r\nFor the simulation we make further assumptions as follows;(i)S(0) is considered\r\nto be the whole population in 2016(ii)We considered homogeneous mixing in the\r\npopulation(iii)FORMULA is considered (That is averagely 67 years is the life\r\nspan of HIV+ people)\r\n\r\n\r\nS(0) is considered to be the whole population in 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nWe considered homogeneous mixing in the population\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMULA is considered (That is averagely 67 years is the life span of HIV+\r\npeople)\r\n\r\nEquilibrium Points\r\nEquating the equations in (*) to zero and solving simultaneously we find two\r\nequilibrium points. Disease free and endemic equilibrium points. FORMULA-\r\nBLOCKand FORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nBasic Reproduction Ratio\r\nThis is the number of secondary infections caused by a single infective\r\nindividual in a completely susceptible population.

Table\u00a01 presents the\r\nvalues of the parameters as calculated based on the data obtained.Table\u00a01.Model\r\nparameters as calculated from the\r\ndataParametersValuesFORMULA0.99992581FORMULA0.00007419\u039b17.2\u00b58\u03917.4184VFORMULA\r\n\r\nEquilibrium Points\r\nFORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nBasic Reproduction Ratio\r\nFORMULA-BLOCK\r\n\r\nBasic Reproduction Ratio\r\nSince FORMULA, the disease free equilibrium is not stable and the endemic\r\nequilibrium is stable. Hence, there is going to be epidemics.\r\n\r\nNumerical Simulation\r\nSimulating the above result, Fig.\u00a01 shows the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in\r\nTurkey.Fig.\u00a01.Dynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nA mathematical model for HIV+ is constructed and analyzed. Two equilibrium\r\npoints (disease free and endemic) are found and stability of each of the\r\nequilibrium point was shown to depend on the magnitude of basic reproduction\r\nratio, using Lyapunov function. It was shown that if FORMULA is less than one,\r\nthe disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Also, if the\r\nvalue is greater than or equals to one the endemic equilibrium is globally\r\nasymptotically stable.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe Turkish population in the year 2016 is 79814871, and the HIV positive\r\npopulation is 13646. The value of the basic reproduction ratio is 1.98998, which\r\nis bigger than one. This implies one HIV positive individual in Turkey can be\r\nable to transfer the disease to almost 2 individuals, hence there is going to be\r\nHIV epidemic in Turkey.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nNumerical simulations were carried out and the results support the analytic\r\nfindings. The results in the simulation shows that if appropriate measures are\r\nnot taken, in 50 years to come, there will be more HIV positive individuals in\r\nTurkey as there are susceptible individuals.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe main limitation to our analysis may be that we did not account for the\r\neffect of behavioral change arising both from number of HIV cases in the\r\ncommunity as well as awareness by governmental and nongovernmental\r\norganizations. Secondary, the possible effects of extensive use of\r\nantiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in terms of method of distributing drugs through\r\npublic or private health institution or a combination of both could determine\r\nwhether patients on ARVs revert back to the infective class. This together with\r\nreduced infectiousness due to lower viral loads for those on treatment was not\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nDespite the limitations mentioned above, there are several implications of our\r\nfindings to public health. First, the endemic equilibrium should be brought as\r\nlow as possible especially during the first wave of the epidemic. This model\r\nsuggests that this can be achieved by prolonging the lifetime of the HIV\r\npatients for as long as possible. Second, HIV prevalence at low prevalence\r\nlevels become less sensitive to changes in the dynamics of HIV epidemic because\r\nit is overpowered by demographic changes especially the recruitment of\r\nsusceptibles. At low prevalence levels, there is hence need to track trends in\r\nnumber of persons infected with HIV than tracking HIV prevalence.\r\n\r\nFigure Caption\r\nDynamics of HIV/AIDS in Turkey\r\n\r\nTable Caption\r\nModel parameters as calculated from the data\r\n```\r\n</details>",
