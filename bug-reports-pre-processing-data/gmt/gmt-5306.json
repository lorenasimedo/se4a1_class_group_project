    "body": "**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nWhen making the 6.2.0 release (https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/issues/5290), the deploy-gh-pages.sh script deployed the GMT \"6.2.0\" documentation to the 6.2.0 directory in the gh-pages branch. However, what we expect is a \"6.2\" directory (see https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/issues/5290#issuecomment-855309858). I think the bug was introduced during the migration from Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions (https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/pull/4530), but I haven't checked the changes carefully.\r\n\r\nI'll assign the issue to myself, but help is welcomed.",
