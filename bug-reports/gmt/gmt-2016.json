But in GMT6,  only the last column is optional, and the example fails with an error:\r\n```\r\npsmeca [ERROR]: Mismatch between actual (7) and expected (9) fields near line 2 in file <Standard Input>\r\n```\r\n\r\npsmeca in GMT5 works because it reads the input data via `scanf` statements. However, in GMT6, the psmeca I/O was rewritten (by @PaulWessel?) to use the standard GMT I/O mechanism. \r\n\r\n@PaulWessel Is it possible to make the last three columns optional?",

            "body": "When psmeca was written by Kurt Feigl and Guinevieve Patau in Paris back in the 1990s they took psxy and hacked it into psmeca.  Since then, psxy has undergone many changes but there is one similarity and that is psxy can accept the symbol code as part of the data record and that means the number of data columns vary.  When GMT5 rewrote the i/o I allowed for this via the GMT_COL_VAR mode which is only used in psxy/psxyz and also needed in psmeca.  Of course, the rapid porting of old modules to GMT5 would sometimes have side-effects, especially for modules that I don't use myself.  If there are similar situations in pscoupe etc then check if GMT_COL_VAR is needed that too.",
