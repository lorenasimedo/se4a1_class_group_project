    "body": "The placement of colorbars after an inset of subplot depends on what -B settings were used to draw the frame of the main plot.  That is stored in gmt.frame.  However, this file needs to be isolated from what happens inside the inset or subplot, otherwise a different -B setting will get stored and when we get back to placing the colorbar we have the wrong information.  The short-term solution is to prevent insets in particular from changing gmt.frame while the longer term solution is to do all those levels in separate subdirectories like Russian dolls.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in 6.0.0.  I am pleased to be the first reported of a bug in the new release.",
