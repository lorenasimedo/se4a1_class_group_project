    "body": "The **-Z** option in **project** can be used to create the coordinates of an ellipse in either geographic or Cartesian space. Unfortunately, the Cartesian case had a bug in that it assumed we gave it semi-axes, not full axes like for the geographic case, as well as is the expectations in **psxy**.  This is now fixed.  I also now check that the major axis is not shorter than the minor axis. In addition, I made it simpler to specify circular output (the degenerate ellipse) by just providing the diameter (again, like in **psxy -SE-**).  Finally, I fixed the problem that the Cartesian case used the given angle as an azimuth but as per psxy the angular argument should be the direction CCW from the horizontal.  Given all this, I added a simple test to that plots both a geographic or Cartesian ellipses.",
