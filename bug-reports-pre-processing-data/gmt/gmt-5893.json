    "body": "See #5886 for background.  Lots of GMT modules do not need a grid/image pad and are OK with using a non-pad scanline oriented float matrix from externals via a pointer, but some modules require a pad.  Those few modules can pass the new flags **GMT_GRID_NEEDS_PAD1** or **GMT_GRID_NEEDS_PAD2** and if the input data are given as a matrix _by reference_ then we must switch to _by duplication_ so a pad can be added.  Turns out we had a similar case where a global grid is passed via matrix and the central meridian is in the wrong place, so as you can see the change to gmt_api.c is pretty trivial.\r\n\r\n@meghanrjones please  see if this helps with that issue?  I have added the flags to modules **grdtrack**, **grdimage** and **grdview**, for grids only (will do image the same way once this works).  Once working I can remove the (then) duplicate effort in _gmt_grd_forward_ and _gmt_img_forward_.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
