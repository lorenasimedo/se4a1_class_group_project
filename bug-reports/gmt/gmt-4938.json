Feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please be as detailed as you can when describing an issue. The more information we have, the easier it will be for us to track this down. -->\r\n\r\nI find the description for **-I** argument of `gmt info` may be a little misleading for new GMT users (originally posted at https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/issues/1035).\r\n\r\nIt seems that only when the **-C** argument is combined with **-I**, then the output will be rounded up/down for as many columns as there are increments provided in **-I**. Without **-C**, **-I** only outputs the min/max values for the first two columns no matter how many increments we input. So, we'd better always add **-C** when we use **-I** unless only the first two columns are needed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Test**\r\n\r\nI use [Iris flower dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) downloaded from https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/raw/master/iris.csv to test **-I** and **-C**.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Download the sample iris data:\r\n$ wget https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/raw/master/iris.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Output with -I and -C:\r\n$ awk -F \",\" 'FNR>1 {print $4,$1,$3}' iris.csv | gmt info -C -I1/0.2/0.3\r\n0\t3\t4.2\t8\t0.9\t7.2\r\n\r\n# Output with only -I:\r\n$ awk -F \",\" 'FNR>1 {print $4,$1,$3}' iris.csv | gmt info -I1/0.2/0.3   \r\n-R0/3/4.2/8\r\n\r\n# Output with only -C:\r\n$ awk -F \",\" 'FNR>1 {print $4,$1,$3}' iris.csv | gmt info -C            \r\n0.1\t2.5\t4.3\t7.9\t1\t6.9\r\n\r\n# Output with neither -I nor -C:\r\n$ awk -F \",\" 'FNR>1 {print $4,$1,$3}' iris.csv | gmt info   \r\n<Standard Input>: N = 150\t<0.1/2.5>\t<4.3/7.9>\t<1/6.9>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**GMT DOC**\r\n\r\n1. The description of `gmt info` at [GMT DOC](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/gmtinfo.html#description) :\r\n> As another option, info can find the extent of data in the first two columns rounded up and down to the nearest multiple of the supplied increments given by -I.\r\n\r\nThis is right. When we only use **-I** without **-C**, only the rounded min/max values of the first columns will be output.\r\n\r\n> If -C is combined with -I then the output will be in column form and rounded up/down for as many columns as there are increments provided in -I.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly right. When we use both **-I** and **-C**, we can output the rounded min/max values for each column provided in **-I**.\r\n\r\n2. The detailed description of **-I** at [GMT DOC](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/gmtinfo.html#i):\r\n> Report the min/max of the first n columns to the nearest multiple of the provided increments (separate the n increments by slashes), and output results in the form -Rw/e/s/n (unless -C is set). If only one increment is given we also use it for the second column (for backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\nThe first part of the first sentence assumes **-C** is used, while the second part assumes **-C** is not used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**\r\n\r\nIt's better to revise the description of **-I** option at [GMT DOC](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/gmtinfo.html#i) to explicitly indicate the difference for the two cases, i.e., **-C** is used and is not used. I'd like to help this issue if you think we need to revise a little about **-I**.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n* Operating system: CentOS 7\r\n* GMT version (`gmt --version`): 6.1.1\r\n",
