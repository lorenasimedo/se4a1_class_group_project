It now ships Python 3.9.13 and pip 21.2.4 in the base environment by default.\r\n\r\nInstalling PyGMT in editable mode fails with the following error:\r\n```\r\n$ pip install --no-deps -e .\r\nERROR: File \"setup.py\" or \"setup.cfg\" not found. Directory cannot be installed in editable mode: /home/seisman/OSS/gmt/pygmt\r\n(A \"pyproject.toml\" file was found, but editable mode currently requires a setuptools-based build.)\r\n```\r\nAfter upgrading pip to 21.3 or newer, the installation works again. \r\n\r\nIt's related to a new feature in pip 21.3 (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v21-3), which was released on 2021-10-11.\r\n\r\n> Support editable installs for projects that have a pyproject.toml and use a build backend that supports [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/). ([#8212](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8212))\r\n\r\nSo, it means that users who have pip<21.3 cannot install pygmt in editable mode.",
