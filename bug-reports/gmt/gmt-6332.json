    "body": "It is easy to forget that the blend file region _requires_ a leading **-R** before the _w/e/s/n,_ and since I did forgot I ended up with the wrong results (no inner border and no tapering) and wasted some time trying to figure out why.  This PR makes that **-R** prefix _optional_ and strengthens the checks involved.  It also fixes a potential bug in that the variable _n_ (number of grids read so far) was confused with _n_scanned_ in line 268 (now fixed).\r\n\r\nI will update the documentation for this later as I am working on a figure to help blend users.  I am happy to hear comments on whether or not we make this a deprecation (only document inner as w/e/s/n but quietly accept -Rw/e/s/n) or if we simply state it can be either/or.\r\n",
