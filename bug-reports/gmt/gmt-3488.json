What is basically happening is that when we read in the coarse grid (1x1 spacing) we pass the desired region (here -R10/12.3/5/16), but then the grid check nazi says\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrdsample [WARNING]: (e - x_min) must equal (NX + eps) * x_inc), where NX is an integer and |eps| <= 0.0001.\r\ngrdsample [WARNING]: e reset from 12.3 to 12\r\n```\r\n\r\nand we don't read the value at x = 13 and hence **grdsample** cannot interpolate there.  That check is done by _gmt_adjust_loose_wesn_ and is used in many places.  I think at one point it is somewhat arbitrary if we shrink inward to 12 or extend outward to 13 - it is a decision we made.  But given this example it would seem extending outward is a better choice.  So I think I will try that as a fix first.  If that leads to other problems then the other option is to round the wesn passed in **grdsample** outwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
