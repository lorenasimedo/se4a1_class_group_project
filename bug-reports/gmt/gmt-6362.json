    "body": "Due to the need to add extra rows/cols for some projections and interpolants, we read in extra data from a file if it has it.  However, when an automatic CPT scaling is needed we do not want to include this extra pad data in determining the zmin/zmax limits so we temporarily scale back and recompute the min/max in those cases.  Unfortunately, the calculation that determined the pad was subject to round-off and did not follow what is done elsewhere in GMT (tolerate 10e-12 in such cases.  So 1.9999999 became 1 instead of 2, for instance and junk was considered and min/max changed badly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue.  No test was affected but a figure in a paper started acting up...\r\n",
