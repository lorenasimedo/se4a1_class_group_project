This would seem to be a straightforward check. I'm not sure what fix is needed for the other two beachballs.\r\n\r\n2. For the beachballs plotted in GMT 5.4.5, the nodal lines are not plotted with the pen specification. (Except for the one double couple, at center.) This issue is much less significant compared with the first issue. It's possible that I need to fix the syntax, but I did not see how. (Plus, I don't see why the nodal lines would appear for one beachball but not the others.)\r\n\r\nThe correct plot was generated using a modified version of utilmeca.c, which can be found at the link at the top. It seems like this would be a better starting point than the current version of utilmeca.c. I have not tried to compile GMT 5.4.5 with the modified utilmeca.c to see how it works. Finally, in the repository above I have provided five additional sets of beachballs that would be useful for more comprehensive testing.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n* Operating system: Mac OS 10.13.6\r\n* Version of GMT: 5.4.5",

There are likely some lingering issues with psmeca, but this was the biggest one.\r\n\r\nRather than open a new issue, can I ask why psmeca requires entries in the 11 and 12 columns? Is that true for all input files for psmeca? I did not see this in the 6.0.0 documentation [here](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.0/supplements/seis/psmeca.html). We're not using the -C option, so I don't see why those columns are needed. They were not needed in 5.4.4. (You can see in my script that I created an awk command, but it'd be a pain to do this for all existing psmeca input files.)",

The problem is associated with the lambda2=0 moment tensors, shown in the sixth set of moment tensors. These produce the errors like\r\nWarning: bigisotest failed for record 9, please report the issue to us!\r\n\r\nThe [input moment tensors](https://github.com/carltape/compearth/blob/master/momenttensor/plot/gmt/dfiles/beachballs_ipts2_iref3_lune_psmeca) are extremely simple, as they only have two non-zero entries.\r\n\r\nI documented the testing in this [README](https://github.com/carltape/compearth/blob/master/momenttensor/plot/gmt/beachball_plots/README).

I confirm [here](https://github.com/carltape/compearth/tree/master/momenttensor/plot/gmt/beachball_plots) that it works for me: the lambda2=0 beachballs in the 6th set look good. I renamed some of my scripts and output files to better reflect the gmt versions I was testing. The \"pr2018\" script names will handle the variable number of columns for the psmeca input file (which is not possibly in 6.0.0) -- these scripts can be used with 6.0.0pr2067 as well -- for that version of GMT you get the correct output. I'll plan to update my own tests for a future official release of GMT. Thanks again.",
