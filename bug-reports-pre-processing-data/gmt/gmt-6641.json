Essentially, a name tag to help identify that plot for *any* purpose. There was no *expectation* of use, although it certainly *could* be used, in an auto-generated legend, for example. In my mind, specifying -l was simply making that label available, in the same way that I might specify an \"id\" tag on an HTML element - it can be, and often is, used for any number of things, but there is no hard requirement that it *will* be used for anything.\r\n\r\nWhen I specify a legend specification file, however, I am *explicitly* saying \"This is what I want my legend to be\", and as such I was expecting the specification file to override the labels, and found it surprising when that didn't happen. \r\n\r\nFurther, while you are correct in stating that the phrasing of the documentation doesn't actually state that the spec file would override the labels, the \"OR\" in the section I quoted in the original submission made me think that it was either/or, not both - i.e. \"using the automatically generated legend specification file\" OR \"a filename pointing to the legend specification file\", not that it would use both and somehow combine them with the automatically generated one winning out in case of a conflict. That's apparently just a simple misunderstanding on my part, however.",
