Offending line in _gmtsupport_crosstracks_spherical_:\r\n\r\n`across_ds_radians = D2R * (cross_half_width / GMT->current.proj.DIST_M_PR_DEG) / n_half_cross;\t/* Angular change from point to point */`\r\n\r\nObviously, the meter to degree part is wrong in this case.  Workaround until the bug fix is to give the equivalent spacing in km.\r\n",

Maybe treating the grid as Cartesian is what you want, via -fc?",
