If no holes were found, a warning is instead provided - `[WARNING]: No holes detected in grid - grid was not updated`. I think this is inconsistent with the behavior of other gmt modules. For example, `grdclip -Sa<high>/<above> <ingrid> -G<outgrid>` will still produce `<outgrid>` even if `<high>` is greater than the maximum z-value in the grid. Is there a reason that grdfill is different in this regards?",
