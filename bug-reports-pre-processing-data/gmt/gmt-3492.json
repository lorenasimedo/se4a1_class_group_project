There is a 0.5 ofset in this equation to deal with the fact that the first pixel node is 0.5*xinc from the west boundary.  However, here in grdcut we are passing a previous w/e/s/n boundary for the original grid so that is for pixel grids off by 0.5.  Using those coordinates in gmt_M_grd_x_to_col means we land exactly half-way between pixel nodes and the rounding will go in our disfavour 50% of the time...\r\n\r\nA quick grep shows other places where gmt_M_grd_x_to_col is given west+k*inc type coordinates and we hope to recover k or k+m, but for this to work with pixel grids we would have to pass west+(k+0.5)*inc for gmt_M_grd_x_to_col to return the right column.  Same for y of course.  What is unusual about grdcut here is that it actually checks and reports the problem by comparing the number of nodes set to zero before and after we extend the grid and fill the new nodes with NaN.  So here, there are 11 zeros before extension and 13 afterwards...",
