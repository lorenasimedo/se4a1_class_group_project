    "body": "In these situations, the user may now know the actual dimension of the plot area, hence it is awkward to specify a map width or scale.  The standard way is to leave off the scale or width entirely (internally, we then append ?).  However, two projections (**-Jo** and **-Jg**) have since this was first conceived grown a series of optional _modifiers_ and these were not considered when looking for the end of the main projection parameters.  This PR checks these cases, strips off the modifiers, does the check and possible appenidng ?, then adds any modifiers found.  Hence, expressions like `-JG30/15/+w45` is now correctly parsed to be come `-JG30/15/?+w45` and all is well again.\r\n",
