    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nThe cyclic CPT color lookup does two things:\r\n\r\n1. Wraps the value to fit inside the single cycle then returns the index to the color table row\r\n2. Interpolate in that row between the low and high color values\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the wrapping took place inside _gmt_get_index_ but on the outside the value remained the same.  Hence, when step 2 happened we still have the unwrapped z-value and crazy RGB values are computed (negative).  It a fun twist, those negative values somehow was wrapped within 256 on Intel hardware but got truncated to 0 on Apple Silicon.  While the Intel result gave what I had intended, I did not plan to be passing green as -19.81, for instance, so it is a bad bug that got mostly covered up on Intel (but not quite) but failed on the M1.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates _gmt_get_index_ to accept a pointer to the value so that it can be adjusted.  I checked MB-System, GMT/MEX, GMT.jl, and PyGMT and nobody is using _gmt_get_index_ so the prototype change should not bother anyone. The rest of the changes deals with the fact the argument is a pointer, and the only place outside gmt_support.c was gmt2kml.c which only needed the index.  An updated and correct PS file is included as well.",
