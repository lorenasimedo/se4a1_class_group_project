On **input**, any column after the _first two_ (x, y) may be affected by **-di**:\r\n\t`if (col_no > 1 && gmt_input_is_nan_proxy (GMT, GMT->current.io.curr_rec[col_no]))\t/* Input matched no-data setting, so change to NaN */`\r\n2. On **output**, all columns that have a NaN will be changed by **-do**:\r\n\t`if (GMT->common.d.active[GMT_OUT] && gmt_M_is_dnan (val)) val = GMT->common.d.nan_proxy[GMT_OUT];\t/* Write this value instead of NaNs */`\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of this being discussed in the docs, so we can choose to make this a feature or a bug :-).\r\n\r\nI assume I skipped examining the x,y coordinates since those are unlikely to be flagged as -99999 as such a point would not be useful in a data set (x,y by itself could be useful as a station location even though the observation z is invalid).  However, I did not think that through as many datasets are instead time or spatial series (t,y) in which case perhaps the 2nd column should be affected by -di) or simply a list of observations (e..g, the one-column input to histogram).\r\nThe fact that a NaN x or y can be replaced on output by the chosen -99999 or similar seems to suggest the limitation in input is a bit dumb.\r\n\r\nProposal: Since the unique value (e.g., -99999 or similar) is unique (there won't be another one like 9898989 for column 4, for instance), I think it makes sense to apply this to all columns both on input and output.  We would then declare a bug since we currently do not do this on input.\r\nWe instead remember that -d was born from deprecated options like -Nnodata in xyzgrd where we strictly only examined the z [third] column for such values.  In that case, the -di is close in spirit but will also do columns beyond three\r\n\r\nI think the first proposal makes most sense, and we also require some documentation clarification.
