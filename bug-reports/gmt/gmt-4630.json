Feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nI am trying to plot a pattern fill as an overlay over another map. To do, this I would use gmt grdview with a categorial cpt containing the pattern information. Unfortunately, the result comes out as solid black fill (see image attached), no matter what do to change the pattern fill specification, resolution, etc. Consider the following simplification of my plotting script:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please be as detailed as you can when describing an issue. The more information we have, the easier it will be for us to track this down. -->\r\n\r\n**Full script that generated the error**\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nmodule load GMT\r\n\r\ncat << END > pattern.cpt\r\n0 p5+r200\r\nEND\r\n\r\ngmt grdmath -R0/3/0/3 -r -I1 0 = test.nc\r\n\r\ngmt psbasemap -R0/3/0/3 -JX3 -B0 -P -K > test.ps\r\n\r\ngmt grdview test.nc -R -J -T+s -Cpattern.cpt -O -P >> test.ps\r\n\r\ngmt psconvert -A -Tg test.ps\r\ngmt psconvert -A -Tf -Z test.ps\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- It helps a lot if you share any data files required to run your script. You can drag-and-drop them here or paste a link to Dropbox/GoogleDrive/etc. -->\r\n\r\n**Full error message**\r\n\r\nno error message is generated \r\n\r\n<!-- Tip: you'll get more detailed error messages if you add -Vd to your gmt commands. -->\r\n\r\n**Actual outcome**\r\n\r\nA black box. See [this thread](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/grdview-with-pattern-fill-ends-up-solid-black-without-pattern/1173) for the image.  \r\n\r\n<!--The output produced by the above script, which may be a screenshot, console output, etc.-->\r\n\r\n**Expected outcome**\r\n\r\nA box filled with the specified pattern fill.\r\n\r\n<!--A description of the expected outcome from the above script.-->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n* Operating system: Centos7.x\r\n* GMT version (`gmt --version`): 6.1.1\r\n",
