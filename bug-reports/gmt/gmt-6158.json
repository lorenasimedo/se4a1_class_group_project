    "body": "We have a **+n** modifier to deal with short vectors and can shrink the head and vector attributes.  However, if **+n** is not used and the (fixed) head size exceeds the vector length, what should happen? Here is an example that compares what happens for geographic and Cartesian vectors (plain and regular):\r\n\r\n![full_heads](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/147424341-3f2f5095-8add-4e8f-9703-c36f49031720.png)\r\n\r\nThere is consistency between Cartesian and plain geovector, but the filled-head geovector just vanishes when we hit the critical length = head-length.   I think we want consistent behavior, and here are two possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Do exactly as the Cartesian cases do (and then fix the geovector case).\r\n2. Refuse to draw any head if head > length (and fix the 3 other cases).\r\n\r\nThe second solution would at least draw a short line that\r\n\r\n1. Indicates the true vector length (no longer hidden by large head).\r\n2. Indicates the azimuth (which _is_ clearer with the large head).\r\n\r\nI suspect there is no obvious answer here so perhaps this warrants a modifier, e.g., **+n** with no args means stop drawing head if it is longer than the vector length [Default does as in the top 3 plots]. I guess I do not like the current default since the magnitude of the vector is basically lost behind the vector head, but rather than breaking backwards compatibility I would be OK with the argument-less **+n** solution.\r\n\r\nComments, @GenericMappingTools/core ?",

One thing I noticed is that we have a variable called vector attribute _v_stem_ set to 0.1 (10%) and the header says\r\n\r\n`gmt_plot.h:\tfloat v_stem;\t\t/* Min length in % of visible vector when head is large [10%] */`\r\n\r\nThis is not (yet) possible to change by the user.  What it means is that the vector length needs to be 10% longer than the vector head for us to draw the vector head, so that 10% of the \"stem\" will stick out behind the head.  I think I just added this as it seemed dumb (to me) to just have a vector head and no stem at all (which is the limiting case if _v_stem_ is 0).  Interestingly, this feature was only applied to geovectors and not Cartesian vectors.  So, options:\r\n\r\n1. Agree that 10% is about right and remove _v_stem_ and use a named constant instead.\r\n2. Disagree that this was useful and remove _v_stem_ entirely.\r\n3. Decide it needs to user accessible by yet another modifier **+f**_fact_ [0.1].\r\n\r\nOptions 1 and 3 means we also do it for the Cartesian vector.  Note: The GMT 4 vector is unaffected by any of this since it is just a legacy implementation.\r\n\r\nI don't like 3 since there is already too many modifiers, but if you see value then I don't mind adding that.  Option 1 which I implemented is a bit subjective, so I will be fine with taking option 2, but my default position is 1.  What you think, @meghanrjones and @joa-quim ?\r\n\r\n",

A few of the failures are silly and has to do with arrows I have placed on some plot to highlight a thing or indicate handedness of a polygon.  For some cases, some of these arrows are now \"too short\" to be plotted.  Yet, in my mind they are kind of arrows on a line (like psxy -W) but I cannot do anything about them since I am just plotting a fixed vector given data from the grid (so I cannot easily fudge a longer line).  My options are\r\n\r\n1. Adjust the scripts so the arrows show (usually making the arrow heads abit smaller).  This still means a PS file update.\r\n2. Add **+n**_limit_ for those cases so that the arrows plot but sizes will vary.  Also means update PS file.\r\n3. Add flag that says do plot head regardless so it can be used in these cases.  E.g., the **+n** with no arg would mean \"no shrink and no skip\".  This means PS original is still good.\r\n\r\nGiven the failures I see it would be handy to turn off the skipping of heads for those rare cases that it is needed.  I already have added an internal flag for this since it was needed to solve the trimmed line as well as GRAPH basemap axes; all that is needed is to connect **+n** with that parameter.\r\n\r\nI think this is the best option to avoid breaking even other peoples script without there being a solution, and also minimizes the need for PS orig updates here.",
