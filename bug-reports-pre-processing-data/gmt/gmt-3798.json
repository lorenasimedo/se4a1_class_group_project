Together with the warning message\r\n```\r\nbash scri.sh\r\npsconvert [WARNING]: Input file has transparency but your gs version 9.51 has a bug preventing it - please downgrade to 9.50\r\n```\r\nThe warning message started to show up when we satarted to check the gs version number. It happens that I built ghostscript from source a little after they released 9.50. At that time the breaking transparency was not yet in the code but the version number had already been increased. We need to do something about it but the shipped in gs has been there since 6.0 and w had no complains so far (not countong this one ofc).\r\n\r\n![swh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/537321/89109275-a4b77e00-d437-11ea-89a1-2226e280084f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
