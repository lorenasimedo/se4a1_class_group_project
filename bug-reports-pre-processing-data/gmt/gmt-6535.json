    "body": "The **NORM** operator in *grdmath** and **gmtmath** says it will convert A so that `max(A)-min(A) = 1`.  This it does, but not it a good way.  For instance, if your data set generally goes from 3.0 to 3.5 and you call **NORM**, you get a result that goes from 6-7 instead - hardly a useful transformation.  What is needed of course is to say that **NORM** converts A so that `min(A) = 0` and `max(A) = 1`.  This bug (and bad documentation) has now been fixed for both **grdmath** and **gmtmath** with this PR.\r\n\r\nNo tests were affected.  Here is what it used to look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngmt math -T0/1/0.1 T 0.5 MUL 3 ADD =\r\n0\t3\r\n0.1\t3.05\r\n0.2\t3.1\r\n0.3\t3.15\r\n0.4\t3.2\r\n0.5\t3.25\r\n0.6\t3.3\r\n0.7\t3.35\r\n0.8\t3.4\r\n0.9\t3.45\r\n1\t3.5\r\n\r\ngmt math -T0/1/0.1 T 0.5 MUL 3 ADD NORM =\r\n0\t6\r\n0.1\t6.1\r\n0.2\t6.2\r\n0.3\t6.3\r\n0.4\t6.4\r\n0.5\t6.5\r\n0.6\t6.6\r\n0.7\t6.7\r\n0.8\t6.8\r\n0.9\t6.9\r\n1\t7\r\n```\r\nand this is after the fix\r\n\r\n```\r\ngmt math -T0/1/0.1 T 0.5 MUL 3 ADD NORM =\r\n0\t0\r\n0.1\t0.1\r\n0.2\t0.2\r\n0.3\t0.3\r\n0.4\t0.4\r\n0.5\t0.5\r\n0.6\t0.6\r\n0.7\t0.7\r\n0.8\t0.8\r\n0.9\t0.9\r\n1\t1\r\n```",
