So the problem must lie somewhere in how the **figure** argument is eventually passed to **psconvert** via gmt end.  It is the same with gmt **begin**.\r\n\r\nPS. This continues my CostCo saga for metal prints of large maps: After receiving a flawed print and talking to CostCo support I learned that they have an undocumented \"bleed\" of 0.125\" on all sides, hence if you wish to defeat their auto-cropping you must add the bleed up front, so that a 36x24 inch image at 300 dpi actually should be submitted as 10875x7275 pixels (with 75 pixels, nicely divisible by 2 (not) is cropped).  Hence, I would like to add **A+m**_bleed_ to my script but alas that fails.\r\n",
