Due to changes in 6.0 or 6.1 related to automatically computing an unspecified legend width, we had a new branch that had not been tested by one of our tests and hence this problem was not discovered earlier.  The fix was easy - just ensure the selected font is chosen in the _PostScript_.  I have added a test for this case to ensure head, item labels and placed label all use the correct fonts when legend width is unspecified.\r\n\r\nCloses #4707.",
