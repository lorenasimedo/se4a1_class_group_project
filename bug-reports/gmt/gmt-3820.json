In modern mode I think we would like **-C** to be optional entirely  since I do not think **-C** by itself selects anything special (other than giving a cpt).  If **-Q** implies a cpt and no **-C** is given it should use the default CPT, no, like **grdimage**?\r\nIn contrast, **-C** in **plot** _is_ required because it also says we must expect a 3rd data column.  I think in **grdview -C** does not imply anything like that.  So should we declare a bug and implement the above?   ",
