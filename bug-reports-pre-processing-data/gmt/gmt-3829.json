    "body": "The passing of a matrix masquerading as a grid via **GMT_IS_DUPLICATE** [the default mode] now seems to work.  However passing such grids by reference is also allowed, but I suspect there are cases where it cannot be done (since we would need to do something special to the matrix).  Testing is done via testapi_matrix_360_ref.c. Seems to work (please verify if this works from PyGMT, @seisman) but raises an issue related to memory freeing.  Since the matrix data is only pointed to by the grid, I set the grid alloc_mode to external so both of them do not try to free the memory.  However, that also means that the x and y arrays that were created when creating the grid is left at the end.  We could just ignore this rare memory leak or do something about it.  One way is to add info to the struct **GMT_GRID_HEADER_HIDDEN** so that we can free those arrays even those the matrix is left untouched.\r\n\r\nI don't know if @joa-quim is wrapping the gmt_hidden.h file in Julia and so adding a new variable will cause trouble.\r\n",
