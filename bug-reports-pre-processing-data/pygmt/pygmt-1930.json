Try this instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith fig.inset(position=\"jTR+w3c\", box=\"+pblack\"):\r\n    # Use a plotting function to create a figure inside the inset\r\n    fig.coast(\r\n        region=[-125, -110, 30, 45],\r\n        projection=\"M?c\",\r\n        land=\"gray\",\r\n        borders=[1, 2],\r\n        shorelines=\"1/thin\",\r\n        water=\"white\"\r\n    )\r\n    fig.plot(x=-117.55, y=35.7, size=[0.2], style=\"c\", frame=\"afg\", color=\"black\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically, use `projection=\"M?c\"` instead of `projection=\"M3c\"`, which means the size is scaled automatically to the inset box. This should produce:\r\n\r\n![map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23487320/169856803-f7a34c10-a419-4594-a4bf-554db3e51ae2.png)\r\n\r\nYou may need to adjust the width in `fig.inset(position=\"jTR+w3c\", ...)` to make the box be the correct size.",

            "body": "The key thing that happens is the unfortunate selection of **-R** and inset size (square).  That map is not square, so GMT finds that the hight with `-JM3c is 4.08581069804c` which exceeds the square so it applies the scale 3/4.08581069804 so that the max dimension is 3c.  That means the width is actually 2.20274522369c which is what is used when `-JM?` is converted to `-JM2.20274522369c`.  However, **coast** passes the buck to the function _gmt_DCW_operation_ that plots the **-E** stuff and clearly there is some issues with what projection parameters are used.  I will have to debug to see why, and once I understand what happens it should be doable to fix it.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what to do for the unfortunate selection of **-R** and a square inset.  It is not easy for the user to know what is the best **-R** that gives a square map for some projection.  Perhaps we need to come up with a better implementation here.  Maybe the inset command should be `+w3c/?` to indicate we want GMT to compute the height of the inset since it is unknown.  Or similarly `+w?/3c` to fix the height and let the width be determined.  To me, that seems reasonable: The user selects the region and we compute the missing dimension.",

So instead of specifying `+w3c` in `position`, you can set `region` and `projection` parameter so that GMT can automatically determine both width and height of the inset for you.\r\n```\r\nwith fig.inset(position=\"jTR\", box=\"+pblack\", region=[-125, -110, 30, 45], projection=\"M3c\"):\r\n    fig.coast(\r\n        land=\"gray\",\r\n        borders=[1, 2],\r\n        shorelines=\"1/thin\",\r\n        water=\"white\"\r\n    )\r\n    fig.plot(x=-117.55, y=35.7, size=[0.2], style=\"c\", color=\"black\")\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, `inset`'s `region` and `projection` parameters are not aliased in PyGMT v0.6.1. As a workaround, you can use the following code instead:\r\n```\r\nwith fig.inset(position=\"jTR\", box=\"+pblack\", R=\"-125/-110/30/45\", J=\"M3c\"):\r\n```",
