Feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nI am cleaning up some minor typos and adding a few clarifications to the **movie** man page and came across this one. It is a minor one, but the documentation for **-N** says\r\n\r\n**Note**: If the subdirectory exist then we exit immediately.  You are therefore required to remove any\r\n    old directory by that name first.  This is done to prevent the accidental loss of valuable data.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty explicit.  However, the module simply calls \r\n\r\n```\r\n/* Create a working directory which will house every local file and all subdirectories created */\r\nif (gmt_mkdir (workdir)) {\r\n\tGMT_Report (API, GMT_MSG_ERROR, \"An old directory named %s exists OR we were unable to create new working directory %s - exiting.\\n\", workdir, workdir);\r\n\tmovie_close_files (Ctrl);\r\n\tReturn (GMT_RUNTIME_ERROR);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere _gmt_mkdir_ is basically acting like `mkdir -p` on the command line.  So, if the directory/directories exist, no problem.  I am not sure what is best here.  The reason for the sentiment in the docs was that if you spent 5 hours running a movie creating 2000 PNGs it would be annoying to have another movie call with the same **-N**_prefix_ quietly destroy that directory.  Yet, when you are testing and fine-tuning your movie, you will rerun that command again and again and it is then annoying to have t remember to do `rm -rf prefix` first.\r\n\r\nI suppose many of you do not have lots of experience with this to have a good opinion, but let me know what your guts say.  I am leaning towards changing the code to follow the docs.\r\n",
