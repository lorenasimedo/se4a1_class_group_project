It turns out pscoast is _not_ hanging but just taking a very long time (many minutes).  The result is shown here.  The technical problem is this: Unlike the GSHHG data in pscoast (which have been chopped into small pieces that are reassembled to make a quick-fill puzzle, the DCW polygons are painted as they are.  For the US this involves a polygon of > 700,000 coordinates.  After projecting and converting to PostScript units we send it through psl_shorten_path which removes intermediate points along straight line segments.  It is this function that is the bottle neck as it does not scale well for large number of points.  There are two solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Replace this algorithm with something faster (even if less perfect).\r\n2. Package the DCW polygons like we do the GSHHG data and apply the same pscoast on-the-fly machinery for painting.\r\n\r\nThe solutions are not mutually exclusive, of course.\r\n![t](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/53518526-5dc09e80-3a75-11e9-95c5-dc76b93439f3.png)\r\n",
