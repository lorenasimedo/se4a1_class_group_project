This PR adds a new testapi_matrix_360.c test program in C that recreates the same type of problem.  The plot with a zero central meridian looks fine but the one for 180 is not rotated to show the Pacific and has a nasty notch at Greenwhich instead.  I will try to make this case work once I better understand the reason.  Initial attempts to rotate the grid failed, so there is more to it.",

Problem I have is it takes Xcode so long to completely cmake up a new branch, and since this branch adds a new C file I need to wipe and start fresh since otherwise it complains about missing C module (if I switch back/forth with master).  So my plan is to put this into master now and then when a fix is found we can merge and backport as well.  If there is no problems with this plan then please approve.",
