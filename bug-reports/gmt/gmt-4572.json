Long story short, I think my best option is to dump the output into a table and then call xyz2grd with the associated range and the proper flags for pixel-node registration, so GMT can format the files as it needs.  I encountered this bug while testing that process.  \r\n\r\nLonger version: Python's netcdf libraries don't have a concept of pixel-node vs gridline-node registration. Reading pixel-node registered netcdf files into Python apparently loses that information.  Then, when you write a netcdf file from Python, the resulting registration seems to depend in horrible ways on your operating system, the age of your computer, and your choice of float32 vs float64 (see : https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/writing-netcdf-from-python-changes-pixel-gridline-node-registration/954).   It doesn't seem to matter which netcdf library I'm using.  So, the pathway through xyz2grd is the best I've come up with so far.  Let me know if you need more information! ",

Or for now, use your workaround.  If you were able to do the \"grd2xyz\" part from Python to a binary file (e.g., floats) then -**ZBLf** would not be affected and work much faster for larger files.",
