The ellipse will be filled with the color or shade specified by the **-E** option [default is transparent], and its outline will be drawn if **-L** is selected using the pen selected (by **-W** if not given by **-L**).\r\n\r\nWe can either stick to that and update the code to give errors, or we can update the docs to say that in those cases (no ellipse fill or outline selected, but a nonzero confidence level specified) we default to an outline with the default pen, via\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (Ctrl->S.symbol == CINE && Ctrl->S.confidence > 0.0 && !(Ctrl->E.active || Ctrl->L.active))\r\n\t\tCtrl->L.active = true;\t/* If confidence is > 0 but neither -E or -L is set then we turn on -L to pick up -W pen */\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the history of this working as is, I suggest we do the latter and update the docs.

In geodesy_03.sh we set` -A1c+p3p+e -Wthin,red` but what we get is the 3 point wide line requested for head outline (which works) being also applied to the stem, yet in red.  Our docs for vector attributes are pretty clear on this:\r\n\r\n> **+p**[_pen_] sets the vector pen attributes. If no pen is appended then the head outline is not drawn. [Default pen is half the width of stem pen, and head outline is drawn]. Above, we used +p2p,orange. The vector stem attributes are controlled by **-W**.\r\n\r\nSo I think there is not much to do here but declare a bug and fix the test scripts in the process.",
