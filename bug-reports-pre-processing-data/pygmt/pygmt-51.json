When trying gmt python  I followed the guidelines available and could install it without a problem. However, a colleague could not run his scripts any more since gmt python changed some packages, it appears. Judging from error messages it traces back to the fftw part that is used by both gmt and shtools. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKonwill\r\n",

We use the conda packages so that we can easily distribute the GMT binaries as well. I can see how having two versions of fftw can mess things up. Unfortunately, we can't use system libraries in a way that makes GMT portable or easily installable. \r\n\r\nOne recommendation I would have is to install GMT and GMT/Python in a separate conda environment. See [this comment](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-python/issues/30#issuecomment-318490930). \r\n\r\nThe GMT/Python wrapper doesn't require the conda version of GMT. You could also build GMT from source (you'll need the trunk version of the code from the repository). This way, GMT would be linked to the system fftw and wouldn't install a separate version.",

That seems to be the problem with the conda-forge FFTW: https://github.com/conda-forge/fftw-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/build.sh#L6\r\n\r\nThis will be a problem for the conda package for SHTOOLS. A difficulty in getting conda packages is that every dependency needs to have a package so that you can have an isolated and reproducible environment. So we would need to have a SHTOOLS compatible FFTW first.\r\n\r\nThere is already an issue on the feedstock (https://github.com/conda-forge/fftw-feedstock/issues/16) but it's been sitting there for almost a year. I might take a shot at implementing this when I have some time.\r\n\r\nAnd of course I'm more than happy to help setup the conda package!",
