    "body": "This PR simplifies the handling of temporary files.  Before, various parts of GMT would do this manually: Set up a template that contains the XXXXX pattern, call _mktemp_, then maybe append an extension. If a temp dir exists then that was prepended.  Then we sometimes create the file, in which case there is a choice between how this is done on Windows and Linux.  Now, all this is cerntralized into two new functions:\r\n\r\n`EXTERN_MSC int gmt_get_tempname (struct GMTAPI_CTRL *API, char *stem, char *extension, char path[]);`\r\n\r\nThis function takes a desired filename stem (or NULL, which means use \"gmttemp\"), possible file extension (e.g., \".nc\" or NULL) and makes a unique system file name.  This file could then be used for making a temp directory, for instance.\r\n\r\n`EXTERN_MSC FILE *gmt_create_tempfile (struct GMTAPI_CTRL *API, char *stem, char *extension, char path[]);`\r\n\r\nThis function also creates a unique name and then opens that file for writing.  This step depends on the OS as Windows uses _mktemp_ and then we must create the file with _fopen_, while Linux uses _mkstemp_ which does both in the same system function.  The difference is related to a potential race condition: Between creating the file name and creatling the file another process could have done the same and the file already exist.  This is extremely unlikely for us so I am not to concerned; this is probably more for servers with endless file i/o.  Anyway, this function abstracts us away from those detail in where it is used.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass, and this will hopefully address #5763, but this PR is good regardless by eliminating duplicated codes.\r\n\r\nPS. Apologies for lots of nonsense changes in gmt_plot.c - it has to do with my editor first replacing tabs with four spaces and then me undoing it, which also removed four spaces in places where they are not indentations...\r\n\r\n",
