Then the next cell is painted and it will overlay any previously plotted neighbors outline by half that pen width.  Since outlines start in one corner (SW I think) and draw clockwise, and cell sizes are under the control of the user (scale, increments) then the line going from W to E along S is not in sync with the line going from E to W along N in terms of dash vs gap locations; that would require you to do some serious math up front to figure it out - if at all.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is that it probably makes no sense to use a dashed pen with **-T**.  if you just want to draw dashed gridlines on top then use -B.  Note that even if we delayed all the outlines until all the polygons were painted then you would get a very similar mess except for the loss of half line thicknesses.  But you would not get nice dashed lines with the same dash lengths.\r\n\r\nOpen to suggestion if you think we need to \"warn\" the user on the man page that dashed lines makes no sense",
