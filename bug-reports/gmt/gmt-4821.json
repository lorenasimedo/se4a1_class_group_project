            "body": "Right. here is what I think is happening: A user is using the GMT Windows executables.  These have various #ifdef WIN32 branches that compiles in certain behavior.  Some of these related to path separators.  However, these binaries may be used in either git bash or cmd.  When used in git bash we should presumably issue bash system commands and not match commands, whereas if run in cmd batch it is the opposite.  Note, this is pretty much just limited to movie and batch where there are scripts written and system calls issued.\r\nFOr batch and movie, the key thing is the input scripts.  If they are bash scripts then everything movie/batch do should be done assuming system will execute a bash script properly.  If input is a batch file then we write batch files and run things that way.\r\nSo the solution is to decide on any path formats based on the current script language mode and NOT place those under any if-defs.\r\n",

The only remaining ifdef I have now is this block which I thought I'd show you:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#ifdef WIN32\r\n\tif (Ctrl->In.mode < GMT_DOS_MODE)\t\t/* A bash or csh run from Windows. Need to call via \"start\" to get parallel */\r\n\t\tsprintf (cmd, \"start /B %s %s %*.*d\", sc_call[Ctrl->In.mode], script_file, precision, precision, frame);\r\n\telse\t\t\t\t\t\t/* Running batch, so no need for the above trick */\r\n\t\tsprintf (cmd, \"%s %s %*.*d &\", sc_call[Ctrl->In.mode], script_file, precision, precision, frame);\r\n#else\t\t/* Regular Linux/macOS shell behavior */\r\n\tsprintf (cmd, \"%s %s %*.*d &\", sc_call[Ctrl->In.mode], script_file, precision, precision, frame);\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this says that if you use the windows movie binary to run bash or csh scripts, we need to launch those scripts like this via system:\r\n\r\n`start /B bash movie_master.sh 001`\r\n\r\nto get them run in the background.  I guess this is still correct? While if you are using DOS batch files it becomes\r\n\r\n`start /B movie_master.bat 001 &`\r\n\r\nDoes the & make sense here in a DOS call?  I guess it must since I know you at least tried to globe.bat example successfully.",
