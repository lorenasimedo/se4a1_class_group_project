Feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem**\r\n\r\nSee this [forum post](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/failed-to-plot-large-multiple-polygon-vector-shp-file-in-pygmt/3064/8) for an example - I have had similar ones in the past but not understood the issue fully.  Now I do.\r\n\r\nThe PSL library, in order to keep PostScript files reasonably small, uses a smallest increment unit of 1/1200 inches.  I.e., it rounds to an effective dpi of 1200.  This means any pen thickness is a multiple of 0.06 points. Note, the DPI in GMT 4 used to be 300. We therefore only write _integer_ PS units.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few places (including angles), all coordinates and pens are given in integers which are 1/1200 inches or 0.06 points.  If you specify a pen of 0.06p then PSL writes `1 W` to set a pen thickness of 1 PS unit.  Smaller pens gives `0 W`, a zero-width pen, which is what **-Wfaint** means.  So -W0.0000000001p will still work fine - it is by definition the thinnest line possible by the PostScript device (printer, gs, whatever).  Telling PostScript to draw a line with pen thickness 0 is thus valid.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we set dashed lines we specify the length of each dash and the gaps between them.  We use the same units there.  So, -W0.001p,lightseagreen,- is means a dash of 8 units with a gap of 4 units, i.e., two lengths of 0.008p and 0.004p.  These, when converted to our PS unit yields 0.133333 and 0.066666 PS units.  Being below 0.06p they round to 0 and we end up with `[0 0 ] 0 B` which is not allowed by PostScript.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different solutions here:\r\n\r\n1. We could add a check that if any of the dash or gap lengths are 0 PS units then we skip setting a dashed line since it would result in an error.\r\n2. We could write the _setdash_ output using floating point.  Here, that means [0.1333333 0.06666667] 0 B, a valid setting. If the device is capable of this then we would see dashes.\r\n3. We update our 1200 DPI constant to something bigger, e.g, 12000.\r\n\r\nI dismiss the last one since this will bloat most plot files by a lot without any real improvement.  And it would not fix this problem, since we now have that gap being 0.666667 PS unit which is still 0 and error. I also dismiss the first one as being too cumbersome and will result in solid lines when a dashed one would actually be visible if you zoomed in enough.\r\n\r\nMy preferred solution is therefore to do the _setdash_ using floating points, as we do for angles.  This will prevent this problem from reoccurring. Also, no bloating will occur since this command only happens a few times for most plots, e.g., once per line.\r\n",

Max error 12.5% (e.g., 4.499999 -> 4) */\r\n\t\t\t\tsprintf (&text[len], \"%c%d\", mark, (int)rint (w));\r\n\t\t\telse\t/* Too small for integer, set as floating point */\r\n\t\t\t\tsprintf (&text[len], \"%c%lg\", mark, w);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn english: if the length in PS units exceed 4 then write them as integers, else do floats.  That means we have a max 12.5% round off error for very thin dashed lines (e.g, 0.1p or so - GMT default is 0.25p), and the round off error drops off as lengths increases beyond 4.  Since most of GMT do not use pens < 0.1p it only affects just a few examples.  Perhaps this is OK?",
