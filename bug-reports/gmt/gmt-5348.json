            "body": "Good one.  So when units are given the numbers are internally converted to inches.  Then on output they are reported according to **PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT** [cm].  Your first example is unrelated to this since no units.  So 1c/1c is dimensionless but gmtmath does not know that, so it has the result as 1 (with internal unit inch) and on output that becomes 2.54 cm. Save for 1i/1i. 1/1i is therefore the same as 1i/1i. 1/1c becomes 1i/1c and 2.54 internally (dimensionless but seen as inches) so out comes 6.4156.  If I set PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT to inch and run your examples I get\r\n\r\n```\r\ngmt math -Q 1  1  DIV = 1\r\ngmt math -Q 1c 1  DIV = 0.3937\r\ngmt math -Q 1c 1c DIV = 1\r\ngmt math -Q 1i 1i DIV = 1\r\ngmt math -Q 1  1i DIV = 1\r\ngmt math -Q 1  1c DIV = 2.54\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is better since it still converts numbers with units to internal inches, but then does not do any conversion on the output (assuming inches).\r\n\r\nGiven how **gmtmath** works I do not think I can easily fix this - i.e., keep track of units.  Maybe document that divisions with united numbers will cause confusion.  I will think about this a bit.\r\n",

I think those results are more sensible in most but not all cases.  Or, we could let **-Q** get a small enhancement:\r\n\r\n**-Q**[**c**|**i**|**p**|**n**]\r\n\r\nQuick mode for scalar calculation. Shorthand for **-Ca -N**1/0 **-T**0/0/1. In this mode, constants may have dimension units (i.e., **c**, **i**, **p**) and will be converted to internal inches before computing.  If one or more constants with units are encountered then the final answer will be reported in the unit set by **PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT**, unless overridden by appending on of **c**|**i**|**p**. Alternatively, append **n** for a non-dimensional result, meaning there is no unit conversion during output.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a pretty good solution and documentation, @Esteban82 ?",
