In the PR we merged an hour or so ago (which caused) this, I had change the script that counts the datasets and inserts the count as the first record in gmt_data_server.txt.  All it does now is to just copy the file from the information folder to the data folder.  Yet, the file did indeed have a new first record (99) with the other count (98 - correct) following, thus messing up the parser.  All I can thing is somehow the update script got running before the git revision took places locally?  I searched and there is no wc in any of the scripts so I am puzzled.\r\n",
