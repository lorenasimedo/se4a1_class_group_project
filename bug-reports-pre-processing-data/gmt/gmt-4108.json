One option is simply to populate those by reencoding Symbol to Symbol+, adding in a bunch of special symbols from the standard/ISO charset that can be useful in mixing with the other symbols, such as the _dotaccent_ requested by the OP, but also many others, e.g., some fractions, double-dot (2nd time derivative), some of the accent and umlauts for 2nd derivatives as well, and more.  It seems tricker to insert a font change in the middle of the overprinting of two characters, but I will look at that as well.  So two possible paths for this. BTW, since Symbol+ would just extend Symbol we would do this under the hood and always extend Symbol to include extra glyphs.",
