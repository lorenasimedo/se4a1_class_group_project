I would then undo my changes for the allocation of that **GMT_RESOURCES** array of structs to use GMT's memory allocation and then gmtmex.c can use `GMT_Destroy_Data (API, &X)`.\r\n2. Add another function to the API called _GMT_Free_ (API, void *ptr) that would free GMT-allcoated memory outside GMT, and hence gmtmex.c would call `GMT_Free (API, X)` instead.  And again I would change the allocation to use GMT allocation stuff.\r\n\r\nI think the first might be simpler as it does not extend the API.  Again, this is only an issue for Windows but we want the external code to be the same.  THoughts, @joa-quim @meghanrjones @seisman ?\r\n",
