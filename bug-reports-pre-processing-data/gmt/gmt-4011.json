It is better overall to use our global remote files for this since they are more recent and it avoids clogging the cache with such files.  There are a few more on my radar but they involve geoid+topo plots so I will wait until we are offering geopotential data.\r\nNot sure if this goes to 6.1 since not a bug, but it is an improvement in documentation since we now are more consistent.  OK, talked myself into it.",
