    "body": "In GMT, the smallest grid possible is 1x1 but only if pixel-registration is selected (otherwise it is 2x2).  However, we did not handle the assignment of increments internally when reading such grids and we could crash for that rare case of 1x1 since we would read the vector (of length one) and then do the` inc = xy[1] - xy[0]` to get the increment (which cannot be obtained that way if no vector).  Since xy is allocated to the longest dimension (1) we should exceed valid array bounds.  MacOS does not care apparently but this would probably crash on others. Upon reading we get confused messages like this:\r\n\r\n`grdinfo [WARNING]: The x-coordinates and range attribute are in conflict; must rely on coordinates only`\r\n\r\nHowever, we have the _actual_range_ setting though and that is now used to get the increment.  This and a few other checks have been added to handle this case.  Also, I added language to the cookbook about the smallest grids possible in pixel (1x1) or gridline (2x2) format.\r\n",
