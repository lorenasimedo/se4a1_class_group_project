This should just draw the outline of the frame (circle or half-circle)\r\n3. Default (no **-B** given):  Should be the same as **-B+n** I think.  Nobody expects a basemap in grdcontour if no -B is given either.\r\n\r\nCurrent, no **-B** gives this interesting plot:\r\n\r\n![map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/86668334-3e515400-bf8e-11ea-829a-bc6e7a053302.png)\r\n\r\nAny objections to this plan, @GenericMappingTools/core ?",

In our _gallery.sh_ test script we have a typo regarding gridline intervals in azimuth: `-Byg190`, all the other places we use -`Byg90`, so a \"1\" slipped in.  But it does not matter since **psrose** simply _overrides_ that with a 30 degree selection if you did not specify an _annotation_ interval (never mind we do not annotate anyway except for the W,E,S,N labels).  So this is another bug: Ignoring the users gridline specification.  I know **rose** is old and has some quirks, but no other program automatically draws gridlines, so I think we must declare this a bug and fix it.  The goal must be for **-B** to work the same across the suite.  I assume @seisman agrees with this stand, yes?",
