Remember there is only one plot being made, and in PostScript.  By selecting \"ps\" the canvas is fixed at A4 or whatever media is selected.  The algorithm for cropping can thus not automatically apply cropping - how would we know what you want? Since you did not want cropping (PS), how can we read your mind and decide you want the PNG to be cropped?  You basically want two different plots here in one go and that is not possible.  Since I am pretty sure nobody has any real need for a PostScript plot anymore (no?), you would request eps,png.\r\n\r\nI think all we can do is add documentation that says if you select PS you are effectively turning off media cropping and will get products determined by **PS_MEDIA**.",
