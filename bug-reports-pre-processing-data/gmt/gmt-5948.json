    "body": "When a grid via a matrix is passed by reference and there is no need to switch to duplication, we adjust the grid's pad to simulate a cut.  However, we never updated the header zmin/zmax to reflect the new data region.  This PR takes care of this for grids (and cubes).  Closes #5294.\r\n\r\nPS: In the process I moved the relevant functions from gmt_grdio.c to gmt_api.c since they were only called there and this eliminates some duplication of macros as well as eliminating a few exported functions.",
