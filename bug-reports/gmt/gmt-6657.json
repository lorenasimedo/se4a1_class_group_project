    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nMost of the testing of **gravprism** was done with geographic grids, so the whole dance of converting degrees to meters has been tested well.  However, I am now working on oblique grids in km so ran into an issue with the conversion of km to meters.  And also found there was a lack of checks for NaNs.  This PR does the following\r\n\r\n1. Fixes the bug where _i_scl_xy_ was used instead of _i_scl_z_ to convert heights back to (km) on output.\r\n2. Now checks if the grid given via **-S** or **-T** contains NaNs, which means we are outside the volume of interest.  However, without an explicit NaN check we will not know this.\r\n3. Move the message about what units are used head of the **-C** code since otherwise it will not be printed for some types of runs.\r\n\r\nTests pass plus my own work with km grids now is correct.",
