The first (wrong) plot does compute a mean half-way between the peaks etc.  It just does not know that this data is periodic and one cannot take the mean  like that when **-w** is on.  I am not sure what is the best, but an analogy with a circle would suggest I need to fit a _von Mises_ distribution to this rather than the normal distribution.  I.e., basically it is statistics of data on a circle.  I know how to do those things, so will see how to implement it.  ",
