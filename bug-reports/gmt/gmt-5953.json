Hence, a bunch of tables created in **gmtmath** did not get freed and resulted in a memory leak (only seen if compiling with -DMEMDEBUG). This PR tries to fix this by setting the correct alloc_mode, but this opened up another issue that had been hidden due to the first bugs: The current example (there may be more) is when **pscoast** creates a dataset from DCW and then passes that to **psxy** for plotting. The dataset and tables are now properly alloc_mode'd but since it was created at the same allocation level as **psxy** (2), the **psxy** module destroys the data upon completion.  This is not known in **pscoast** that also tries to free it and by that time there is junk in that memory, causing other crashes.\r\n\r\nThe general problem seems to be this:\r\n\r\n1. Module 1 (level 1) calls module 2 to create a dataset.  This is allocated at level 2.\r\n2. Module 1 (level 1) then calls module 3 to make a plot with this data. \r\n\r\nModule 3  operates at level 2 and hence seems nothing wrong in destroying memory allocated at that level.\r\nModule 1 then tries to free it but it has already happened.  Seems I need to rethink how that can be communicated.  I've renamed this branch WIP. So master works fine but there are unseen memory leaks in places.\r\n\r\n",

The functions that allocate a dataset, table, or segment structure (e.g., _gmt_get_dataset_) now set the allocation level and mode right off the bat.  This was missing in some cases and that drove the garbage collector man crazy.\r\n2. Module **pslegend** was sloppily written where perhaps 64 segments were allocated up front but then only 13 were actually used, so we just set `S->n_segments` to 13 without reallocating the memory like normal people would do.  So once the stricter checking on when to free kicked in, this causes major troubles.  Now, we properly reallocate to the needed space before passing things into other modules.\r\n3. When a dataset structure is passed by reference we make sure the passing object is set to NULL once the receiving object holds the data, otherwise we would have two pointers to the same memory and that is never good when one of them frees the data and then the other tries the same later...\r\n\r\nA few comments were also added.  This should strengthen the API for dataset virtual use.  Please give it a spin asap.\r\n",

I had a single alloc_mode variable for a segment, but when externals provide columns it is possible that only some are provided externally and others are allocated in GMT.  So the segment alloc_mode must be a vector as well and we must set the mode for each data pointer to INTERNAL or EXTERNAL so that freeing can work.  Still testing now after many changes.",
