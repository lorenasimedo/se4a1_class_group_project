    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nGMT only supports regular grid spacing. So when passing a grid to GMT API, it's always assumed that the grid has regular spacings in x and y dimensions.\r\n\r\nWhen irregular grid spacings are detected, we raised an exception, but the detection may be too strict (see #1468 for the issue report). In this PR, a warning is raised, instead of an exception.\r\n\r\nFixes #1468\r\n\r\n**Reminders**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run `make format` and `make check` to make sure the code follows the style guide.\r\n- [ ] Add tests for new features or tests that would have caught the bug that you're fixing.\r\n- [ ] Add new public functions/methods/classes to `doc/api/index.rst`.\r\n- [ ] Write detailed docstrings for all functions/methods.\r\n- [ ] If adding new functionality, add an example to docstrings or tutorials.\r\n\r\n**Slash Commands**\r\n\r\nYou can write slash commands (`/command`) in the first line of a comment to perform\r\nspecific operations. Supported slash commands are:\r\n\r\n- `/format`: automatically format and lint the code\r\n- `/test-gmt-dev`: run full tests on the latest GMT development version\r\n",
