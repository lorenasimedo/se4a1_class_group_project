However, there is confusion between two sets of regions (_wesn_i_ and _wesn_o_ in the code) and in this case they end up being off by 360 between them.  This is not detected since it is not a global grid.  I am surprised this situation has not appeared before. Anyway, the added code is another safety value that ensures the two regions are compatible and deals with any 360 shifts before the critical adjustments below.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass, including my example above.\r\n",
