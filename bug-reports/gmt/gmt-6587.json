I guess these are MBsystem etc which likes to grid in random degree increments and not, say arc seconds....\r\nI will need to find where it ix happening and see if we are too relaxed on teh check for -R.  I suspect the -R is just a hair outside the grid nodes (e.g., 10^-8) so it adds one more row and column and boom we have 513x513.\r\n",
