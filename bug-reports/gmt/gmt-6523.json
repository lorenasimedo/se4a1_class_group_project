While the clipping worked fine, the fact that the path extends too far means **ghostscript** senses these excursions and hence the bounding box is too large.\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates that problem.  I also added more comments to explain the otherwise cryptic section.  The plot below show an actual 3-D image clip path.  The BB of the full projected image is 0/8.37/0/3.
