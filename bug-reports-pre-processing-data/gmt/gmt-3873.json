    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nAddresses #3843.  What happens here is that the _gmt_new_grid_ determines that the input grid is a memory grid so it duplicates another grid since it will be written into.  Because the input grid was a matrix it had no padding, so we get a grid with no padding.  Unfortunately, the **grdgradient** algorithm requires at least 1 pad row/column. I have added a new argument to _gmt_new_grid_ (a _minimum_ pad required) and pass that for each module.  It is usually 0 (pad is not going to be needed) but for **grdgradient** it is 1.  There may be future places where 2 might be needed.  Now, _gmt_new_grid_ will extend the pad to the minimum required if it is too small.  @seisman, please see if this fixes #3843 - I did not yet test it...\r\n\r\n",
