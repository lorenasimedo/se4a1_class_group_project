I actually have some local code to implement that but it'll take time to get into PyGMT properly.\r\n\r\nCould you describe in a bit more detail what you're trying to plot? If I'm reading this correctly, are you interested in showing the figure inline inside of an IPython terminal?",

I can see where you're going here (I've written a similar thing before with matplotlib). So yes, the problem is that PyGMT's `fig.show()` doesn't quite work that way (yet?)...\r\n\r\nCould you point me to some sample code on what that `plot_` function looks like (a non-gmt one will suffice). I can see you've opened a GMT milestone at https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/milestone/1",

            "body": "@MarkWieczorek I started a branch for implementing #269 (PR coming soon) and here is what I have working:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `Figure.show()` will open an external viewer and return something that Jupyter knows how to embed in the notebook. There is no need for `method=\"enternal\"`.\r\n2. Calling `pygmt.enable_notebook()` will disable the external viewer. This can also be set with an environment variable. I don't really like this but I don't think there is another way that is always reliable. matplotlib does this by deep integration with Jupyter (i.e., jupyter has code to handle matplotlib figures) which I don't think we can mirror yet. \r\n\r\nSo you could have `fig = grid.plot_gmt(projection='...', ..., show=True)` and things should work the way you expect. \r\n\r\nRegarding inserting plots in matplotlib, the problem is that the figure would be a raster. We could get a PNG returned by PyGMT and insert that as matplotlib axis. The problem is that it looks bad when exporting the figure later on. This was my original idea for the display mechanism but I gave up on it at the time. The \"best\" way to do this would be to translate postscript to matplotlib's vector format but I doubt anyone would be willing to do it. I'm not even sure it's possible since GMT does a lot of coding in the postscript itself. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is can find a way of inserting raster into matplotlib in a way that it looks good, I'd be happy to implement this in PyGMT. Mixing GMT and matplotlib in the same figure would be a dream!",
