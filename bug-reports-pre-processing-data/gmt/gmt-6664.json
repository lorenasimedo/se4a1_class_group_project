Depending on forward vs inverse it can also save intermediate grids, such as detrended or the complex components.  However, when we have called the inverse function and plan to write the _final_ real result, I think we should ensure we demux the grid, eliminate excessive memory, and then pass to _GMT_Write_Data_.  It should not be the job of all the various sub-functions dealing with ways of \"writing\" that grid to file or memory to have to clean up the demux from the few modules who do this.  Thus, while the above fix works, it will not be what I end up doing since there are other fish to fry.  Basically, the three modules doing FFTs will need to clean up their acts before writing the result.",

            "body": "I am working on two changes but today I am headed to Cambridge so more on this tomorrow I hope.\r\n\r\n- 100% of GMT usage and probably most other use one can think of expects the final inverse FFT to yield a real grid (no more imaginary values stored anymore).  Turns out GMT returned the real grid interspersed with the (now zero) imaginary components, and then the belly of _gmtapi_export_grid_ took care of the demuxing.  I have now modified _GMT_FFT_ so that unless a new flag is passed (**GMT_FFT_NO_DEMUX**) it will take care of the demux and eliminate the space used for the imaginary values.  This means any export (i.e., via externals) should immediately work like for any other grid.\r\n- In the event some developer or a future module would need to pass **GMT_FFT_NO_DEMUX** then we need a way to eventually do the demux.  Thus, I am introducing _GMT_FFT_Reset_ which will do that step separately and can then be called when needed.  It does nothing unless the _complex_mode_ flag in the grid header says it is a complex grid.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, **grdfft**, **gravfft** and **grdflexure** all get real grids back and I have removed the special flag on output via _GMT_Write_Grid_ that says to do the demux (since that is not supported in the external exporters).  You can try this branch - should be OK - I think I ran it with the Julia example.",
