I used to use:\r\ngmt **blockmedian** tmp1 **-W+s** -R0./360./-81./81 -I7m/5m -fg -r -V > tmp1.1\r\nand got good results. But today when I tried to run it again, the output had 0 size. When I removed the -W option or just used -W, it worked fine. I wonder if the -W+s option is not available anymore or it is just a bug?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please be as detailed as you can when describing an issue.
