    "body": "This PR started as a fix to the problem reported via #6587, which was due to a recently imposed check in **grdfilter** that one should not supply Cartesian distance computations with geographic grids.  Because in this particular module (**grd2kml**) I actually need Cartesian treatment I thought I could just add **-fc** to fix this. But no, then we had some trickle-down issues.\r\n\r\nBasically, users have always had the option of using **-f** to override what a grid file says it is.  Typically, one may read a Cartesian grid that perhaps should be seen as geographic, and then using **-fg** makes it so (this is for modules where there is no mapping i.e., **-J** is not used).  However, the opposite turned out not to be true: If you have a geographic grid but wanted it to be treated as a Cartesian grid then **-fc** did _not_ do that since **-fc** is parsed first and then when the geographic grid is read we recognize it as such and basically **-fg** is set.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to _remember_ that we set **-fg** or **-fc** and then apply it.  This PR checks at the end of _gmtapi_import_grid_ to see if we need to impose one of them, as well as the start of _gmtapi_export_grid_ to see if a change should apply to the output.  Great, simple as that.\r\n\r\nNow I got failures from all the **grdflexure** tests! In debugging one of them I learned that _GMT_Get_Values_, which is this clever API function that understands units, temporarily may set **-fg** but then leave it as is when it returns.  So in **grdflexure**, after parsing `-E5k`, the **k** for km triggered **-fg** (even if a 5 km plate has nothing to do with geographic data) and then the 0/600/0/600 region was seen as too big for geographic...\r\n\r\nWIth these fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Add memory to **-fc** and **-fg**\r\n2. Apply that memory just before writing or just after reading grids\r\n3. Reset col types and **-f** settings to what they were when _GMT_Get_Values_ is used\r\n4. Pass the **-fc** flag to **grdfilter** from **grd2kml**\r\n\r\n all seems OK again and the original problem is fixed.",
