However, they tend to use different values (I am skipping the exponent since those magnitudes may change depending on m or km etc):\r\n\r\n- gravff, grdgravmag3d, gmtgravmag3d: 6.667\r\n- talwani2d, talwani3d: 6.673\r\n- gravprism: 6.674\r\n- \r\n\r\nPer [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant), the value as of 2019 is 6.67430 x ....\r\n\r\nI suggest we place this constant in a separate include file inside the supplement so that all the modules can use the same value and also only have one place for it. WOuld that be OK with @joa-quim ? We can have different exponents or use 1.e-? as needed?\r\n",
