Should be using GMT I think. Doing that it loads and compiles. Set the stop point and run.  It gets to my stop point inside GMT_Call_Module but then the debugger progress wheel is spinning and no more action...  I probably have to build with a prior Xcode version, which is painful.\r\n\r\nAs for why the BCs: Two concernsL (1) no, I cannot think of a reason why this is done since is a linear projection and nothing needs to be resampled.  I thought we checked for that anyway. and (2) if the grid is readonly but has no pad then I know we allocate a new grid with pad to do the resampling.  in your case, it has a pad already, so is not caught by that test.  I guess it should get caught as a read-only here regardless.\r\n",

Since we cannot change the grid we make changes to the padding settings in the header.  So the pad may be larger since the actual desired grid is a small part of what was given.  That way we do not reallocate anything.\r\n2. IN preparing the user grid for what comes later we apply the BC which only changes the pad.  Does it bother you that the pad changes? I suppose we might be able to find a way to reset it to zeros in the end.  We are certainly not checking if the pad has zeros or not as that is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nSo I guess, what is the problem with GMT making changes to pad values as long as it is not allocating or freeing user memory?\r\n",
