Feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\nAs I was testing a **grdmath** macro to obtain _Parsons and Sclater_ [1977] depths from an age grid, I noticed something odd.  If I run\r\n\r\n` gmt grdmath -R200/240/40/60 @earth_age_01m_g PS77 = depth_ps77.grd`\r\n\r\nthen the grid is correct with a range in depths from 2535 to 5356 meters.  However, grdinfo says a bit more:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\ndepth_ps77.grd: v_min: 2535.00390625 v_max: 5356.30371094 name: z\r\ndepth_ps77.grd: scale_factor: 1 add_offset: 0\r\ndepth_ps77.grd: Default CPT: @earth_age.cpt\r\n```\r\n \r\nBecause the default CPT inherited from the age grid is passed along, and that CPT is set to go from 0 to 340 Myr, trying to make a simple map fails:\r\n\r\n![bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/180605671-f59548c6-d82e-47b3-a82e-4a209f96a05b.png)\r\n\r\nI have to specify a master CPT for this to work:\r\n\r\n![good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/180605692-417388fa-c407-440a-9dcd-c6fe0db6026e.png)\r\n\r\nIt is not immediately obvious to me when we should wipe the incoming CPT.  Well, it is in the sense that we are concerting unit from Myr to m and thus the old CPT should be irrelevant, but **grdmath** does not know that.  Even a simple operation that does not change the units will fail due to the new range:\r\n\r\n`gmt grdmath -R160W/120W/40/60 @earth_age_01m_g/ 500 SUB = t.grd`\r\n\r\nwould not plot a black ocean map.  So there seems to be two possibilities here:\r\n\r\n1. **grdmath** should always wipe the default CPT setting in the output grid\r\n2. **grdmath** should leave it along and we write a Note in the documentation to explain the problem.\r\n\r\nI think we have to go with (1) here.  It is a relatively obscure problem and people will not read that section and just be frustrated why their basic plot is blank.  I think this is the only module where this sort of thing can happen (unit change or wild range change). Any opposing voices, @GenericMappingTools/core ?",

So a one-liner plot of the input grid worked well (x and y were both km so we properly do the same scale for both axes) but the one-liner for hte output grid came out ugly and square because that axis info was lost.
