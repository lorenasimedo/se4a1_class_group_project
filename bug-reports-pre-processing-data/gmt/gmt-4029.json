My first attempt doing this caused failures and I could not find the problem, so that branch has been deleted and this one was carefully built up by multiple commits, each added after testing showed all x2sys tests passed.  Should now be good to go.  The essence of the changes is to return an error code back to the calling module which then can call _Return_ (error) instead of a hard _exit_.\r\n",
