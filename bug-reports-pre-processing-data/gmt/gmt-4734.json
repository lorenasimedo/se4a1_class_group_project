    "body": "This issue follows up on comments by @meghanrjones in #3344. In **classic** mode, **PS_MEDIA** is _always_ used to set the paper size of the PostScript plot as the only supported graphics format.  The default paper size is either A4 or US letter, but this is typically changed via **PS_MEDIA** for larger maps or specialized plots.  This behavior is correct and has not nor will not change going forward.\r\n\r\nHowever, for **modern** mode all the PostScript plotting is removed from the users direct control in several ways.  For instance, the default graphics format is PDF, but users can specify a range of raster formats, EPS and PS.  Apart from the pure PS choice, all other formats imply a limitless canvas (actually, limited to 11 x 11 meters), and then we crop the canvas do what was actually used.  In this context, **PS_MEDIA** should have **no** purpose.  A complication arises should a user request several graphics formats with one being PS, such as in\r\n\r\n```\r\ngmt begin map ps,png\r\n   gmt coast -Rg -JH180/15c -Gpink -B\r\ngmt end show\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere there is a mix of plots that must be cropped (png) and one that has a specified paper size (whatever **PS_MEDIA** says).  Since in reality we always make a PostScript file first, what should be behavior be in this case?  Right now, both the PNG and PS plot actually have the size of the default paper size for PostScript [A4].  I think the correct behavior should be:\r\n\r\n1. Always plot using the infinite canvas\r\n2. For ps (PostScript output), crop this boundingbox to what **PS_MEDIA** says\r\n3. For other formats, crop to fit (as per **PS_CONVERT** settings)\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure what a user imagine they want by asking for a PS. Say they ask for EPS instead. Well, setting eps,png yields a correctly cropped EPS file but still a page-sized PNG!  I doubt that is what is expected, but who knows what goes on in the minds of users.\r\n\r\nSeems to me we should enforce the rule above, making all PDF, EPS, and rasters cropped to the plot size, while PS output is cropped to the page size.  Any guru who for whatever reason wants a PNG with exact page size can make the PS then run **psconvert** as needed.  I cannot really see the need for this in modern mode.\r\n\r\nComments, @GenericMappingTools/core ?\r\n",

Since **PS_MEDIA** default is a4 already setting PS_MEDIA to a4 does not change the setting but now we want it to be honored, so to speak.  Complications:\r\n\r\nI do not think we can assume that some gmt.conf in the current directory which happens to have **PS_MEDIA** letter or a4 is actually an attempt of the user to enforce a fixed size PNG plot.  While the gmt.conf will be included in the session (unless begin -C is used) I think **PS_MEDIA** cannot interpreted that way.  It should take an active gmt set PS_MEDIA a4 to change that.\r\nPerhaps a better solution is for the user to change **PS_CONVERT**? The default is \"A\" which means crop to size. I think this is a better solution (also avoids the misnomer of PS_* being applied to rasters).  The only issue is how to pass a blank string (i.e., no A) via **gmt begin** _name_ _psconvertopts_.  Trying `gmt begin map png \"\"` did not work, so we probably need a dummy psconvert option we can give that means \"enforce media setting\".  Perhaps **-N** for \"eNforce paper size\"?\r\n",

            "body": "we are going to get so many emails about why their PNG plot has so much whitespace around it - only to eventually learn they had some old gmt.conf laying around from a classic gmt command and once they deleted it everything worked again.  I think it is better to insist that we always crop, regardless of begin -C or now, UNLESS the user actively turns off cropping.  Since we have A+n already for that purpose, why not use that in those rare cases when media cropping is desired - this is the solution I am working on.",
