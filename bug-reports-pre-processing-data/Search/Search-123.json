I created this PR because I think it would give concrete benefits to our project:\r\n- Deterministic builds on Travis\r\n- Fixed local tox environments that are not re-created every time you run tox\r\n- Docker images that have the latest requirements installed. It doesn't make sense to `pip install -r requirements.txt` on our docker images, if the versions there are from 2 years ago and which we didn't even test, but that's exactly what we do. Another option is, as @jankrepl said to not install `requirements.txt` at all, and just do `pip install .`. This would work, but then you can't use layer caching and have to install all dependencies every time you want to build a new docker image, which takes a while. (Currently we pre-install old requirements from `requirements.txt` and so use layer caching. All our servers run on old requirements from `requirements.txt`)\r\n\r\nTo me it doesn't make sense to have a `requirements.txt` with old requirements that we don't test against. So either we update it and use it, or we don't use it and delete it and use `setup.py` with `pip install .`.\r\n\r\nI guess that's the real question here, which model do we want?\r\n1. `pip install --no-cache-dir .` &rarr; delete `requirements.txt`\r\n2. `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install .` &rarr; update `requirements.txt`",
