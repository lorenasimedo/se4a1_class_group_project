I think you have to doctor this by\r\n\r\n1. set the pad as you do\r\n2. Modify the header->wesn to reflect that (ie., extend region if pad < 2 and shrink if > 2.

Once that is done you call the virtual file\r\nYou should be able to verify by looking at the header and sizes etc that the grid/matrix has the properties you want before doing the module call.\r\n\r\nSorry, bedtime for Bonzo here now.",
