    "body": "When **+n** is used to shrink vector attributes for vectors shorter than the threshold, we failed to shrink the pen for the vector head.  This PR addresses this shortcoming and updates the two geovector test plots for grdvector (_shrink.sh_ and _wrapped.sh_).  I fixed this for the small circle vectors as well but we have no examples of this use so no tests.  Updated two PS files as a result of the change.\r\n",
