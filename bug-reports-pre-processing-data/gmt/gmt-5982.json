Then there is a renaming from old to new.  That renaming section was _not_ under file locking and hence the _gmt_server_data.txt_ file could get clobbered by **movie** or **batch** when multiple processes are trying to update the file.  This only happens if you start a **movie** or **batch** job 24 hours since the last time you access the server table, and then _N_ processes would try to clobber the same file...\r\n",
