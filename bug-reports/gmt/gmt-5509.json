    "body": "**spectrum1d** has a long history, initially writing individual files for each cross-spectra component.  Then we added the capability to write a single table with all the cross-spectra in separate columns to _stdout_ by default, but this could be turned _off_ via **-T**.  Because of backwards compatibility we left the default action as it was, hence **-T** is needed to turn off a call to _GMT_Write_Data_.  Thus, _GMT_Encode_Options_ needs to check for **-T** and if set it should deactivate the implicit output argument.\r\n\r\nNote: I think it is very rare if any externals uses **spectrum1d** and does _not_ want the result back as normal output, but in case they do and use **-T** we do not want a nasty crash.  In fact, I would recommend that external wrapping of **spectrum1d** by default pass **-N** to _bypass_ the individual-written files (which is outside the control of the API) and receive the output as a single multi-column table like from similar modules writing to _stdout_.\r\n\r\nThis PR thus adds the missing check in _GMT_Encode_Options_. @joa-quim should review it, and @seisman should be aware of the Note.\r\n",
