    "body": "There have been several bugs and omissions identified in GMT vectors lately (e.g., #6108) and we have had some partial fixes.  This PR reconciles several problems and completes incomplete enhancements:\r\n\r\n1. The new minimum vector shrink in **+n**_norm/limit_ was documented to default to 0.25, but in fact it was never set so it was still zero.  This is now fixed.\r\n2. The check for geovectors to skip heads if they exceed the vector length was flawed so some small vectors ended up with bad heads (e.g., #6108).  Now the test is fixed and heads exceeding size are not plotted.\r\n3. Cartesian vectors never bothered to check and hence always plotted the heads even though exceeding the vector lengths.  This has now been addressed.\r\n4. Finally, there are uses of vectors where the vector length should _not_ be considered when plotting heads (e.g., adding a head to an existing line). Many of these are internal (e.g., adding a vector head at the end of the line via **plot -W** or adding one at the end of a math x-axis for **--MAP_FRAME_TYPE** = _graph_), but placing flow vectors on a graph may also fall prey to the limitation.  Using **+n** without any argument now means we always plot the requested heads regardless of vector length.\r\n\r\nThese corrections meant that 8-10 PostScript plots needed to be updated. For some I chose to use **+n** to avoid having to change the  plot, while others would benefit from a refresh (e.g., properly giving scaling in km for geographic vectors in _sample.sh_).\r\n\r\nCloses #6158 and #6108; the latter is also the inspiration for new test _met_uv.sh_",

            "body": "Interesting.  The decision to draw head or not is just\r\n\r\n`if (dr[0] > h_length_limit)`\r\n\r\nso there is nothing I can do code-wise to beat any roundoff.  As for the test, I guess we would have to hunt for a slightly different scale or initial head size that gives the same plot?\r\n\r\nAnother take: I am about to improve the documentation on the geovector and Cartesian vector as the docs are not clear enough.  Basically, the geovector means you specify a length in map units (km, for example) and then we plot that length on the map.  This means the actual plot length on the paper depends on the map projection.  A 50 km-long vector at Equator is half that of one at 60N.  This is not what people who have vectors in other units (plate velocity, wind speed, etc) want, since it is biasing what the user sees.  For those applications they need to plot Cartesian vectors, which do have the same length regardless of location and projection.  To make matters worse, we have some tests that mixes these cases up, such as met_uv.sh which you can see is using geovector due to the -Si20k setting instead of, say, a -Si5c argument (random number, not sure what it needs to be to be visible).  But for some perspective projections (-JG for instance), a geovector is suitable for those applications since the length is affected by the perspective.  Documentation with figures on the grdvector page is needed for this.\r\n\r\nSo I think I will fix met_uv.sh to use Cartesian vectors first, and then we can see if that causes different images for different OS.  OK?\r\n\r\n",
