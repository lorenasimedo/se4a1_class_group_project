    "body": "Now that I have spent some time in the _seis_ supplement to do animations, there are several aspects of **coupe** that I find odd or wrong:\r\n\r\n1. The **-A** option has a **+f** modifier to \"get the frame from the cross-section parameters\".  What this cryptic phrase means is to get the 2-D Cartesian **-R** domain implied via **-A**.  For instance, with **-Ab**128/11/120/250/90/400/0/100+f that implies **-R**0/250/0/100 but for other variants of **-A** it is not that simple.  What **+f** does is to update the internal **-R** setting and use these new parameters in setting up the plot, i.e., it _overrides_ any given **-R**.  However, if **-R** is not given in the first place then we get an error since **-R** is a required option.  Also, **+f** is usually used for fonts, and that is even true elsewhere in the _seis_ supplement, so it is a bad modifier choice (it derives from the old syntax which as a trailing **f**).  Finally, the syntax of **-A** is abhorrent and for some reason avoided getting a haircut via new modifiers during the GMT 5/6 revisions.\r\n2. The **coupe** man page is silent on the most common use of **coupe** (vertical crossection) and should inform that you must use a negative y-scale to get depth down.\r\n3. When animating via **events** I found that for plotting beachballs with polarity dots using **-Z**\"-Sc3c -Fa0.1i/cc\" the polarity dots selected via **-Fa** have fixed size.  So when the beachball gets autoscaled by **events**, the polarity dots stay at 0.1i.  I think it only makes sense to have the whole symbol scale.  This is a bit complicated since **coupe** basically plots two symbols, and the size I read from the input file (computed by events) is for the main **-S** symbol and cannot be used for **-T**.  I think the same is true in **meca**.\r\n4. The documentation for **-A** needs to start with an upper case sentence.\r\n\r\nHere are proposed changes I am thinking we should do:\r\n\r\n1. In a backward compatible way, redesign the **-A** option to be\r\n **-Aa**_lon1/lat1/lon2/lat2_**+d**_dip_**+w**_width_**+z**_min_/_max_[**+r**] and **-Ab**_lon1/lat1_**+s**_strike_/_length_**+d**_dip_**+w**_width_**+z**_min_/_max_[**+r**] (and similar for **-Ac** and **-Ad**).  We could have sensible defaults for dip [90], etc.\r\n2. Improve the man page on the need for vertical negative scaling for depth down and fix formatting\r\n3. Find a way to let **-R** be an optional switch if the **+r** modifier is given in **-A** (one simple way is to just add -R0/1/0/1 when **+r** is given and **-R** is missing before we hit GMT_Parse_Common).  Or better: If **-R** is not given then **-A** sets **-R**, no **+r** should be needed.\r\n4. Change **event** -> **meca**/**coupe** scale information so that we still pass on an actual fixed size in **-S** and **-F**, but then these numbers are modulated by the scale (not size) found in the new column.  This will require a hidden mechanism for these modules to know they are being called by **events** (which I think I can do).\r\n\r\nFinally, along (4), it is a bit jarring to see symbols change size in the animation, yet pen thicknesses stay the same.  So for smaller scalings the pen is too thick at times.  I think the solution suggested for (4) should extend to **plot** and **plot3d** as well so when called from **events** with a variable scale column the scale applies to the _entire_ symbol, including pen widths.\r\n\r\nComments needed, especially from coupe users (@seisman ?).\r\n",
