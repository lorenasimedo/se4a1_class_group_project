We need to take steps to prevent building the movie during testing because 13s is too long for a single test. I think we should use `-Fnone -M150,ps` in the script with a note that the YouTube mp4 can be generated using `-Fmp4`. This way, the master frame generation is included in the tests without generating the full mp4.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to exclude the scripts from the tests entirely by modifying doc/scripts/CMakeLists.txt.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think that the animation would look better in the docs after the description.
