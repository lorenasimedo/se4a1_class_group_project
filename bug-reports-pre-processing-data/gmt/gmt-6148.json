    "body": "As I was testing new remote data sets, the updated gmt_data_server.txt happens to have directory names that at first were long, then got shorter. This change allowed me to find this bug: We are copying over a string except for the last character (the slash), but we never terminated the string, so that a longer name would still be present at the end of a shorter one.  This made a string compare fail that previously had worked.\r\n\r\nNo affect on any tests since this only applies to the future.  The future is coming soon.",
