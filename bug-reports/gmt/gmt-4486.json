            "body": "The **mapproject** module is messy because it has added lots of capability over the years.  I am re-learning that this issue comes down to knowing when **mapproject** needs **-R -J**.  For instance, when one is using **-G** to get distances there is no **-R -J** requirement (it is _optional_ if you wanted the coordinates to be projected).  I think this is the list of conditions when **-R -J** is _required_:\r\n\r\n1. When **-I** is used to get inverse projection rather than forward projection\r\n2. When **-C** is used to set origin offsets for projected values\r\n3. Otherwise, when none of **-A -G -L -Z** are selected\r\n\r\nThere are also some options that I think precludes **-R -J** from being involved as well:\r\n\r\n1. When **-E -N -Q -T** are selected there are no -R -J involved.\r\n\r\nI will add checks to _gmt_init_module_ that will add the \"RJ\" requirement when it is clearly needed.\r\n",
