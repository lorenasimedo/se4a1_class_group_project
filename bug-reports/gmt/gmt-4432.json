    "body": "**Description of proposed changes**\r\n\r\nThis PR started with trying to address the [forum request](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/t/how-to-reverse-the-axis-of-the-psternary-plot/978/3) to plot the axes in reverse direction.  This is now an option via the new **-D** selection.  However, in the process of testing this I discovered that the points plotted and the axes orientations where out of sync.  The initial implementation of **psternary** basically assumed that the axes were positive in a clock-wise orientation but instead they were plotted in a counter-clockwise orientation.  A separate PR fixed the ignoring of -N (#4431).  This PR addresses therefore several things:\r\n\r\n1. It adds **-D** to reverse the axes orientations.\r\n2. It fixes the mixup between projecting (_a,b,c_) to (_x,y_) for the two -D settings.\r\n3. It adds a new test (_corners.sh_) that ensures end-member points (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) correctly plots.\r\n4. It adds _-D_ to the existing _psternary.sh_ script so that the axes are in the correct order for that example.\r\n5. It adjusts the placement of vertices labels (**-L**) which is affected by **-D**.\r\n6. It allows any of the **-L** labels to be given as - which skips that label.\r\n\r\nThe psternary.ps original has been updated and all tests pass.  Below is the corners.png result showing correct calibrations:\r\n\r\n![corners](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26473567/98452403-22ec8600-20f3-11eb-967f-363482321a71.png)",

Given **-M** (which requires no **-R -J**) it seemed more flexible to make a separate option for this effect.\r\n2. If we accepted **-JX**-_width_, we would need to strip off that sign, set the internal Ctrl->D.active variable, and proceed with **-JX**_width_ due to how **psternary** was crafted (we do our own annotations, etc, since there are three axes and no GMT ternary-projection or basemap).\r\n\r\nSo perhaps the best option is to allow **-JX**-_width_as well (since many will be familiar with the effect elsewhere) but then do the internal switcharoo as described above.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, we would need to catch a negative width and say something, but I think the proposal above is better.",
