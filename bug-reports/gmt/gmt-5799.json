Unlike that PR, I did not do anything about checking whether GMT_IS_REFERENCE | GMT_IS_DUPLICATE is needed.\r\n\r\nAll GMT and PyGMT tests pass, except one which is wrong (xref https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/issues/1539). I did not test GMT.jl.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/issues/1313\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe changes proposed and **why** you made them. If unsure, open an issue first so we can discuss.-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If fixing an issue, put the issue number after the # below (no spaces). Github will automatically close it when this gets merged. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reminders**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that your code follows our style. Use the other functions/files as a basis.\r\n- [ ] Add tests for new features or tests that would have caught the bug that you're fixing.\r\n- [ ] Describe changes to function behavior and arguments in a comment below the function declaration.\r\n- [ ] If adding new functionality, add a detailed description to the documentation and/or an example.\r\n",
