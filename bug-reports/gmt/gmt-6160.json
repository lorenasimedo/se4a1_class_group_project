    "body": "Related to [new datasets](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/remote-datasets/issues/9). The _gmt_set_unspecified_remote_registration_ function, whose job it is to determine if a pixel or gridline registration version was specifically requested in a remote file name, was written before there was `@earth_geoid` and hence the lame check for _g or _p easily found _g(eoid) and returned prematurely.\r\nThis PR adds the harder work of advancing past the leading dataset name and then look for _g or _p in what remains.\r\n\r\nIn the process I learned I had a typo in the test gmt_data_server.txt file where the earth_relief_01d_g.grd had a missing / in front of server which meant the apimat2grd.sh test failed.  Just delete your test/server/gmt_data_server.txt to get the updated file.\r\n\r\nTests pass.",
