    "body": "We usually read global grids from file and they get rotated depending on the wesn selection.  However, when a global grid is passed from another environment, as **GMT_IS_REFERENCE**, we may be projecting that image in _gmt_grd_project_ and if the repeated meridians fall inside the map (since no rotation has happened) they are counted twice, yielding a slightly different result.  Only applies to gridline-registrered grids.  This fix detects this special situation and skips one of the repeated meridians. Addresses the initial issue raised in #3844.\r\nNote sure about backport.  Was the gmt_whole_earth backported?\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "Not sure.  It was relatively clear what to do for when the repeated meridian lands inside.  While I am not sure why there is  nothing on the west border, I would suspect this has to do with BCs.  When the grid is read in and we know it is global, we use actual data values from the other side to set the two extra rows/cols in the grid data.  THe matrix has no padding, so when it is passed into _gmt_grd_project_, this happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* Only input grid MUST have at least 2 rows/cols padding - otherwise we must allocate a temp grid */\r\nif (I->header->pad[XLO] < 2 || I->header->pad[XHI] < 2 || I->header->pad[YLO] < 2 || I->header->pad[YHI] < 2) {\r\n\tunsigned int pad2[4] = {2, 2, 2, 2};\r\n\tGMT_Report (GMT->parent, GMT_MSG_INFORMATION, \"gmt_grd_project: Input grid has insufficient padding - create and work on a duplicate with r row/col pad\\n\");\r\n\tif ((I2 = GMT_Duplicate_Data (GMT->parent, GMT_IS_GRID, GMT_DUPLICATE_DATA, I)) == NULL) {\r\n\t\tGMT_Report (GMT->parent, GMT_MSG_ERROR, \"gmt_grd_project: Unable to duplicate grid\\n\");\r\n\t\treturn GMT_RUNTIME_ERROR;\r\n\t}\t\r\n\tgmt_grd_pad_on (GMT, I2, pad2);\t/* Add pad */\r\n\tgmt_BC_init (GMT, I2->header);\t/* Initialize grid interpolation and boundary condition parameters */\r\n\tgmt_grd_BC_set (GMT, I2, GMT_IN);\t/* Set boundary conditions */\r\n\tI = I2;\t/* Use this input grid instead */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we end up duplicating the non-padded matrix so we can project.  So assuming the grid/matrix is flagged as geographic, it should end up applying periodic boundary conditions at west and east and it should be the same for the grid as well as the matrix.  But clearly the east boundary differs.  Will see if I can find any inconsistencies.",

For this projection and a gridline-registered grid, the longitude that corresponds to the map west and east will be plotted twice.  Since  the rotated grid (read from file) has a min/max that equal east/west, it is plotted twice and all is well.\r\nFor the **GMT_IS_REFERENCE** grid that is not rotated, the repeated -180 and +180 meridian both project to the the interior of the image (unless we use **-Rd**).  So the earlier fix was to only project one of them and that fixed the reported problem.  However, in the above case, w=-60 and e=300 but the duplicated longitude is still -180/180 for a referenced grid. That means that when we plot the single meridional line for west=-60 we must actually add 360 to its longitude and do it again - otherwise there is nothing projected at the east boundary.  Will try to add such a fix.",
