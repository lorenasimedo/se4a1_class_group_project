    "body": "- I removed the `lprr_baton_rouge_fpcsb_1992_2012.csv` entirely from the pipeline after further review. The original pdf itself is riddled with inconsistencies that are nearly impossible to decipher, which is why the clean script that you originally produced took so much work. Even with that work, it's not certain that the data is accurate only because the data in the pdf itself doesn't make much sense. My two potential solutions are: 1) I'm going to attempt to re-request that document from the agency itself; 2) see if the output is improved after we introduce the new OCR pipeline. Thoughts?",
