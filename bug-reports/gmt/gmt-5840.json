    "body": "It is possible to pass in a colormap with 4 columns, where 4rth contains info about transparency. It is even possible to pass info to GDAL about which color in the colormap is to be taken as the transparent color (``GDALSetRasterNoDataValue``). But since what we pass to GMT is a pointer to the colormap we must tell it also if the colormap has 3 or 4 columns. That is done by multiplying the number of colors in colormap by 1000, and later check if that number is > 2000 to know if we have 3 or 4 columns.\r\n\r\nFurther encoding of the transparent color in colormap is coded by adding the color number entry in colormap to the number of colors. For example if we have a cololrmap with 256 colors and want to the second color as the transparent one, we set ``ncolors = 256 *1000 +2``.\r\n\r\nNow, this used to work but doesn't anymore because when ``gmtapi_expand_index_image`` comes in, it converts the indexed image to RGB but looses the information about the transparency. Saving image with gdalwrite encodes this info but currently when I open that image I cannot see it working, but this is a different issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR, prevents crashings that would otherwise result from accessing the image data with a wrong number of colors.
